 him, then exchanged glances from where they stood atop the Noble Jury.

	"Hello?"  Props leaned in and waved her hoof across Zaid's spiraling eyeballs.  "Zaidy Waidy...?"

	"I don't get it!" Jagold stammered, then gestured at the stack of yellow and white cheese wheels.  "Isn't this something he's always wanted?  Why is he having a seizure?"

	"Uhm..."  Props gulped and smiled bashfully at the two pegasi.  "Don't worry.  That's his way of saying 'thank you.'"

	Smythe squinted.  "He says 'thank you' by foaming at the mouth?"

	"Yeah!  Hehe!"  Props nuzzled the twitching stallion's neck.  "At least, I like to think so!  It explains why he falls out of the bed so much."

	"Eeep!"  Jagold blushed furiously.  "Eggshells!  Whelp... enjoy your cheese wheels!"  She flapped towards the other side of the Noble Jury.

	Ebon Mane trotted up, poked Zaid once, and watched as the stallion tipped over.  He rolled his eyes and smirked at Smythe.  "I'll take it from here.  I just hope I've got enough bread to go with this gift."

	"Good luck with that."  Smythe said and flew after Jagold.

	Ebon stared at the cheese wheels, rubbing his chin in thought.  Eagle Eye trotted up from behind.  "Looks like you have your work cut out for you."

	"Hmmm..."  Ebon nodded with a smile.  "It's all good, though.  I'm always at my best when I'm tackling a culinary challenge."

	"Yes..."  Eagle nodded, then stared down at his fidgeting hooves.  "Yes, I know."

	Ebon blinked.  He turned around and immediately nuzzled the stallion.  "At least... that's how it used to be."

	Eagle gulped.

	"Hehe... what?"  Ebon gazed at him.  "Afraid I'll cary the stink of cheese into the cabin?"

	"I dunno.  I guess..."  Eagle bit his lip.  "I-I sorta regret having to leave this place."

	"Why's that?"

	"Because..."  Eagle gulped and spoke in a quiet tone, "It feels like the first place where I actually f-found myself."

	Ebon leaned in, kissed Eagle on the lips, and murmured in his ears.  "Me too.  But, wherever we're going, I doubt either of us will be lost.  Now, will we?"

	Eagle smiled, his eyes misty.  He brushed his cheek with Ebon's and murmured, "Ebon?  I... I..."

	"Heehee... Yes, EE?"  Ebon gazed at him warmly.  "What's on your mind?"

	Eagle stared back.  At last, he gulped, then spoke in a quivering tone, "It's not m-my mind..."  He had stealthily clasped Ebon's hoof so that it rested over his chest.

	Ebon chuckled breathily.  "You sap."  A wink.  "I love you too."

	Eagle smiled.

	"And later..." Ebon leaned in and whispered in Eagle's ear.

	Eagle's lavender coat turned two shades rosier.  "Guhhh!"  He looked nervously over his shoulder.  "Ebonnnn!"

	"What?"  Ebon chuckled.  "Don't worry!  Belle's and Pilate's cabin are three rows down and on the other side!"

	"Uggggh..."  Eagle rolled his eyes.  "What am I going to do with you?"

	"...I can think of many things."

	"Ahem.  The cheese, Ebon?"

	"Hmm?  Oh!  Right.  Could you lend me a hoof?"

	"Sure.  While they're still clean."

	"Hehehehe..."

	As the stallions trotted across the deck, they passed Josho as he was cornered by a pink-eyed mare.

	"You know... I've been meaning to ask you something since you and your friends arrived here, outsider."  Rayvinne smiled, thin-eyed, as she flicked the very tip of the aging unicorn's horn with her wingfeathers.  "Is that the only part of you that glows?"

	"Yeesh, lady..."  Josho glared at her lethargically.  "No wonder Rainbow's been gone all hours of the day."

	"Oh, please.  She may have the colors of the Valkyrie, but deep inside she's all blue."

	"Yeah.  Probably from punching herself in the face so long."

	"You've got at least an hour before you sail away on your Valkyrie Silver."  Rayvinne waggled her eyebrows.  "Feel like losing some weight?"

	"Y'know, I didn't have the courage to say it until now." Josho stifled a belch.  "But—like—if this whole entire crater was actually one bigass elevator, it still wouldn't lift even half as much as your friggin' tail, girl."
