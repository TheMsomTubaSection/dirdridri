hind her tail.

	Unlike the day before, a fairly thick crowd of Durandanans had gathered.  They murmured with each other, gazing at the two outsiders from afar.  Sivrem and Jerrio flew down, gently urging the group to stand back.

	"How... uh..."  Rainbow murmured aside.  "How many ponies know about what went down yesterday?"

	"You can't keep a secret for too long in the crater," Fawful said.  "Word travels with the wind in a place such as Durandana."

	"Yeah, I get it," Rainbow said with a nod.  "But... that's a lot of ponies? What's to blame, pillow talk?"

	"Too many pegasi and not enough beds," Pilate murmured.

	"Stripesy!" Rainbow hissed.

	"What was that?" Fawful asked.

	"Er... nothing!"  Rainbow chuckled nervously before giving the stallion a swat with his tail.  "Hah hah!  Silly zebra!"

	Fawful stared, squinted, and ultimately smirked.  "How about you go first...?"

	"My friggin' pleasure."  Rainbow turned to Pilate.  "Careful, buddy.  It's dark down there."

	"... ... ..."

	Rainbow rolled her eyes.  "Dammit.  Whatever.  Look, the stairs are steep.  Lemme just carry you."

	"Don't you get tired of doing that?"

	"You kidding?"  She smirked and grasped Pilate from behind.  "Your brohawk scratches the itch on my chin."

	He held his breath as he dangled in her grasp.  "Well, s-so long as we're both comfortable..."

	Rainbow and Pilate drifted down, followed by Fawful and a few other elders.

	"Alright, everypony..."  Sivrem smirked as he nudged the crowd back some.  "Don't be a bunch of loitering gulls, now.  Gust!  Gust!"

	As the crowd dissipated, one pony stood alone.  Jerrio stared dully at the wooden latch as the guards slowly shut it.  After a few seconds, he sighed and looked off with folded ears.



	"Say, you need any help down in the robo-womb, blondie?" Zaid asked across the mess hall.

	"Mmmmff...?"  Props gulped down some celery and shook her head.  "I don't have any metal parts!  I promise!"

	"No, I meant the engine room."

	"Oh!  Ohhhhhhhh... hee hee hee..."  She smiled with rosy cheeks.  "Sure thing!  If you've got nothing better to do!"

	"Well, it's been a good long week since Josho last backed up the lavatory, so—"

	"Grab a wrench and come on down!"

	"Heh!  Will do!"

	Bellesmith sat on a couch in the lounge, sipping from tea.  She glanced up as Zaid and Props trotted by.  A slight smirk crossed her muzzle.

	"Everytime I see them lately, they act as though they are breeding."

	"Gaaaie!"  Belle nearly fell out of her seat.  She spun around, breathless.

	Roarke gazed down, her eye-lenses rotating to a stop.

	Belle panted, panted, and exhaled, "Oh Roarke.  You gave me quite a scare!"  She fanned herself.  "I didn't even realize you were there."

	"I was attempting the casual conversation," Roarke droned.

	Belle stared at Roarke.

	Roarke stared at Belle.

	With a gulp, Belle smiled awkwardly.  "Small talk!  But of course!"

	Roarke's nostrils flared.  "Which of the two do you think will attempt to initiate coitus first—?"

	"Roarke, just—"  Belle raised a hoof, clenched her eyes shut, and sighed.  "...if you want to engage in small talk, you might want to ch-choose a slightly less icky topic."

	Roarke was silent.  Eventually, she nodded.  "I understand."  A fidgeting.  "I suppose I have more weapons to test."  She made for the kitchen door at the far end of the room.

	"No.  Roarke, wait!"  Belle held a hoof up.  She smiled gently.  "Roarke, please forgive me.  I can tell that you're trying very hard.  But... just don't stress it!  We're friends, aren't we?"

	Roarke stood sideways several feet away.  "I suppose..."

	Belle giggled.  "Well, you certainly have saved our skins on several occasions."

	"And have jeopardized it."

	"Yeah, well..."  Belle took another sip, placed the cup down on the table before her, and chuckled.  "Nopony's perfect."  She gestured.  "Have a seat!  You can sit, can't you?"

	Roarke stood, squirmed, and stood some more.  With a slight trilling sound, she eventually
