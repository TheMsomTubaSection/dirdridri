 Kera smiled.

	Eagle and Ebon stared, rosy-cheeked.

	"Unnngh..."  Rainbow rolled her eyes.  "When it rains, it pours." She leaned in and nuzzled Belle dearly.

	"Awwwwwwwwwwwwww," Props cooed again.

	"Eep!  C-careful, Rainbow!" Belle shuddered as the plate before them rattled.  "The cheese!"

	"I always have my eye out for cheese."

	"Heeheehee!"

	"It's so great to have you with us, Rainbow," Pilate said.  "It wouldn't be the same Jury otherwise."

	"Yeah, well..."  Rainbow leaned back with a somber breath.  "The you-know-what is still out on that one."

	"Cute."

	"Mrmmmfff..."  Zaid muttered in mid-scarf, gesturing.  "You know, Awesome Sauce... mmmfff... I was thinking..."  He gulped a bite down.  "There's no reason why you can't have another sword made for you!"

	"Buh?"

	"I've been told just how badflank you were with all the goonie slaying back in Stratopolis!  Maybe—like—we can land in a town around here that has a blacksmith!"

	"Unnngh... Zaid..."

	"For real!"  He grinned.  "I've got experience in making some steel!  We'll give you something new to bite between your teeth!  Maybe something with a snazzier hilt.  I mean, no offense to the righteously enchanted beacon connecting Durandana to Equestria, but that damn blade always looked a bit too plain to me."

	"Really?" Pilate cocked his head innocently to the side.

	"That's it!  I'll get you one with a snazzier hilt!  Bird wings and all that crap!  It'll even match your eyes—"

	"Look, Zaid, you want my opinion on that?" Rainbow droned.  "Do whatever.  For real.  Knock yourself out."

	"Pffft.  Don't you care?"

	"Not really, no."  Rainbow sighed.  "I'm just... through with fighting for a while."  She slumped back in her chair.  "I don't even feel up to kicking clouds at the moment."

	"Nopony's going to force you to do any of the sort, Rainbow," Belle said.

	"Yes, well, give it time," Rainbow said with a tired smirk.

	"Now that's more like it," Josho uttered.

	"Hrmmph... I think differently!"  Eagle Eye stood up.  "Let's enjoy this moment of peace and togetherness!"

	"Ugh..."  Josho rolled his eyes.  "Somepony shoot me.  Roarke?!"

	"No!  I mean it!"  Eagle grinned wide.  "How about a toast?"

	"Erm..."  Ebon fidgeted.  "I-I didn't pour drinks yet."

	Eagle tapped his chin, glanced down, and grinned wide.  He raised a slice of grilled cheese.  "Ahem...To peace!  And Rainbow Dash living the dream!"

	"Spkkkt... Ha ha ha ha!"  Rainbow hugged herself, grinning.  "You for real?"

	"As real as I've ever been!" Eagle beamed.

	"Snazzatron!" Kera hopped up on the table before Belle could stop her, levitating her own slice of cheese sandwhich.  "To Rainbow Dash!"

	"Heeheeehee!"  Props hopped up and raised her slice.  "To keeping things breezy!"

	Pilate stood up, holding a plate out.  "To continued civility..."

	"Spark alive, beloved..."  Belle stealthily replaced Pilate's plate with a sandwich slice and stood up beside him.  "Hrmmm... To a warm reception in Val Roa."

	"To panties!" Zaid shot up, grinning.

	"Hrmmmf..."  Floydien rolled his eyes and stood up.  "To less of this boomer pooper pile."

	Eagle Eye giggled.

	Ebon glanced at his barren place setting.  He hurriedly scooped up a slice from Eagle's plate and stood up.

	"Heh... you guys are impossible..."  Rainbow grabbed a slice and hovered up.  "Just how do we do this?"

	"We just do it!"

	"To the Jury!" Ebon squeaked proudly.

	"To getting this over with!"  Rainbow shoved her sliced forward.

	Everypony followed suit.  With a loud squish, their cheesy sandwiches collided above the table... and stuck together.

	"Whoopsies!" Props blushed.

	"You've got to be kidding Floydien..."

	"You didn't think this out, glitterbutt!" Josho grumbled.

	"Sorr-rr-rr-yyyy!" Eagle Eye managed amidst a giggle-snort.

	As the group struggled to unstick the sandwiches, Props suddenly glanced aside.

	"Uhhh... Zaidy Waidy?"

	"Rrrgh... Yeah, Blondie?"

	"Aren't you forgetting something?"

	"... ... ..."  Zaid
