I felt the changelings in Ledomare.  I felt the changelings in Xona.  I felt the changelings east of Alafreo.  Changelings in places I couldn't possibly even recognize..." She winced and rubbed her head.  "Archipelagos with sandy beaches.  Cities made out of pure metal.  Kingdoms with emerald plains."

	"Was it like..."  Eagle Eye squinted.  "You were in their bodies?"

	"N-no.  More like... we all had the same body..."  Elma blinked at him.  "And we all had the same beating heart.  We were all as one... but we've always been.  Only..."  She sighed with flinching dragonfly wings.  "Only Chrysalis had always blinded us.  With pain and malice and anger and misery."  She stared up at Eagle again with thin green eyes.  "She made us think that it was what we needed to satiate our hunger.  And... we did need it, only there was so much more we could have benefited from.  And when we all realized that—when we all awoke to what we've been missing all of our lives—we all became one.  We unified as one mind... and then..."  Her words fell apart.

	Eagle watched patiently.

	Elma sighed. She stared at the floor.  Eventually, a smile came to her lips.  "We grew up.  We didn't need her anymore.  And, in a way, we didn't need each other anymore.  Now we are all separated... and yet we're still one beating heart, or at least we know that we have the capability of being so.  If we just allow good feelings to flow through us.  Goodness.  Kindness.  Love.  All of that... it's a binding element.  It always has been.  And it's what we were truly hatched for."

	"All of that..."  Eagle tilted his head curiously to the side.  "You grasped in one single epiphany?"

	"I know it's a lot to chew," Elma said.  "It's hard enough for me to put into words.  I was positively floored by the event when it happened.  From what Pilate and Rainbow Dash described of the other changelings, they were no less shocked than I was."

	"But... it was a good thing... r-right?"  Eagle asked.

	Elma winced.

	Eagle did too.

	"Erm... yes.  But... Chrysalis did so many horrible things to us... to me."  Elma inhaled hard, trying to keep a steady posture.  "There's so much to make up for.  And as wonderful as it was to have that moment of an epiphany... of an awakening... it still won't bring back my past.  Or, at least, the past that I believe in."

	Eagle Eye nodded.  "Elma, I am so very sorry for what was taken from you—"

	"Only it wasn't taken from me.  Don't you see?"  Elma grimaced.  "It was all in my head... planted there like the rest of Chrysalis' lies.  But..."  She cleared her throat and clenched her jaws tight.  "I need to keep in mind what Rainbow and Bellesmith have been telling me."

	"And what's that?"

	"That I have the rest of my life ahead of me," Elma said.  "And that this is the opportunity for a fresh start.  To discover myself and see where my life goes from there."

	"And you think that's going to happen in Val Roa?"

	Elma said nothing.

	"Erm... s-sorry..."  Eagle Eye hung his head, sighing.  "This is..."  He gulped.  "I shouldn't be bothering you with all this.  I feel terrible."

	"Yes, you do."

	Eagle Eye glanced up at her, blinking.

	"I... uhm... I-I can sense what you're feeling," Elma said.  "I... I-I always could, really.  I guess I just never gave it much thought."  Her spines twitched and she murmured, "And waking up to who and what I am certainly helped."

	"Then hopefully you feel..."  Eagle Eye stood up straight.  "You know that the ponies on board this ship care an awful lot for you."

	"Yes.  Yes they do."  Elma nodded.  Her green eyes flinched.  "Well, maybe not Roarke..."

	"Heh..."

	"And they love each other very much too," Elma said.  Her gaze lingered on him.  "Some... more than others."

	Eagle's brow formed a bead or two of sweat.

	Her eyes narrowed.  "You're dying to ask something, aren't you?"

	Eagle opened his mouth... lingered... and eventually blurted, "How did you know you were freed from Chrysalis the moment that it happened?"

	Elma blinked.  "That's
