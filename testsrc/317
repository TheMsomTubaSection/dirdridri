eee!"  Kera hopped up and down.  "Hah!  Take that, fatso!"  Kera turned to blink at the others.  "Ledo was fat, wasn't she?"

	"I can imagine another fatso who'd be enthralled to hear this," Zaid said with a smirk.

	Josho stumbled into the room.  "What would I be enthralled about, exactly?"

	"Did you hear the good news, Josh Josh?!"  Props spread her forelimbs with a bright grin.  "Ledomare is now Luxmare!"

	"Hrmph..."  Josho tossed his mane back and grumbled, "Different name, same morons."

	"Awwwwww..."  Props pouted with drooping ears.  "Do I have to be the only pony who's excited?"

	"I'm always excited when I'm around you," Zaid said.

	Prowse's voice crackled through the speakers.  "Huh?!  Who in the bloody hell said that, lass?"

	"Oh.  Uh.  Uhhhhh..."  Props slapped at the dials of the array.  "Crkk-Crkkk!  Oh noes!  Crkkkk!  You're breaking up, Unky Prowsy!  Crkk-crkkk!"

	"You're makin' that sound with your bloomin' mouth, aren't you?"

	"Sorry!  Crkkkk!  Gotta get back to you!  Crkkkk!  Thanks a ton, Zetta!  So happy to hear back from you!  Crkkkkk!  Bye bye!"  Flip!  She slapped the machine off and spun towards the others.  "Well, that was fluffy!"  She smiled.  "No more Council of Ledo!  Why, Pilate, that means you and Belle could fly back there and live without the fear of being whipped to death or something, r-right?"

	"Hmmmm..."  Pilate smiled.  "Not even if you gave me a million working eyeballs."

	"Bleachkkk!"  Kera faux-vomited.  "I'm with the zebra of awesomeness."

	"Yowsers."  Zaid smirked.  "You guys really know how to hold a grudge."

	"Yes, well, the blood of the innocent will do that."  Josho said, then turned towards Pilate.  "You may wanna head upstairs, copper bottom."  He glanced at the array.  "You too, blondie."

	"Oh?" Props blinked.

	"Rainbow's back," Josho said.  "Turns out the local yokels are crazy enough to offer fixing the Jury for free."

	"Oh!"  Props swung her legs and bounced off the stool.  "Coolie Crispies!  I'll be up in a jiffy!"

	"What do you need me for?" Pilate asked.

	"You and Dr. Bellesmith are super close to Elma," Josho said.  He paused, glanced at Kera, then glanced at the zebra again.  "Rainbow and Company just got back from seeing a few members of the Boreal family.  Elma... uh... she may need some coaching on this one..."

		// A Blessing To the Boreals		//------------------------------//

	"We found your family," Rainbow Dash said, almost immediately wincing.  Her eyes traced the walls of the navigation room.  "Elma's family."  She took a deep breath.  "The 'Boreals of the Eastern Heights,' or at least that's what the village elder Boxer refers to them as."

	Elma's green eyes lit up.  "You've talked with Boxer?"

	"Yup.  Totally did."

	Bellesmith glanced over Rainbow's shoulder.  "You know him?"

	"Why... of c-course!"  Elma nodded vehemently.  "Every turtle looks up to him!  We all depend on his blessings.  I met him several times in my hatchling years..."  She winced.  "I... I-I mean... I have memories of meeting him."  She gulped.  "Elma's memories..."

	Rainbow Dash and Belle exchanged glances.

	"Elma..."  Eagle Eye walked past Props and Roarke, smiling gently.  "They would very much like to meet you."

	"They..."  Elma glanced up, shivering slightly.  "They would?"  Her fanged muzzle hung agape as she glanced incredulously at the group.  "But... how?  Why?!  I'm nothing but an imposter!"

	"From the looks of things, what Rainbow and Pilate did in Stratopolis affected the whole world," Roarke suddenly said.  Her copper lenses reflected the green illuminescence from Elma's eyes across the room.  "Even here in Alafreo, the population has witnessed several of their numbers turn into changelings.  You... won't exactly be a surprise."

	"What..."  Elma curled her forelimbs pensively.  "...wh-what have you told them about Chrysalis and the hive?"

	"Nothing," Roarke said, shaking her head.  "All they know is that it was never your will nor your intent to ever im
