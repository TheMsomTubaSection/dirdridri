calm down!  We're here, Kera!  Everything's going to be alright!"

	"Nnnnnghhh!"  Kera was curled up in a little ball on the floor, gnashing her teeth as books and blankets and shredded map parts swirled around her.  "Mommmmmmy!  Dadddddyyy!  He's killing everypony!  I can't stop him!"

	"Oh Spark..."  Belle grimaced, her eyes tearing into the magical wind. "She's relapsing."

	"I b-beg to differ, beloved," Pilate said, shading himself with an oustretched hoof.  "I don't believe she's ever stopped drowning in it."

	"She came so close to begging me to help her again."  Elma gulped.  "Perhaps... p-perhaps it would be for the best if I—"

	"No!"  Belle frowned.  "That is not the solution!  Not for you!  Not for her!"

	"But... but maybe if you just let me—"

	"Pilate!" Belle called over Elma's shoulder.  "Can you get in there?"

	"Yes!"  Pilate said through gritting teeth as he trudged bravely against the telekinesis.  "I do believe so!"

	"If we can just get to her, maybe we can comfort her!" Belle said.

	"I'm... tr-trying...!"  Pilate marched and marched... and slipped.

	Belle braced his body with her own, giving him leverage.  "Here, Pilate.  T-together!"

	"Kera!  We're here!"  Pilate exclaimed, practically tugging himself one hoof at a time into the center of the magical maelstrom.  "Darling, you can relax!  You're no longer in Lerris!  Nopony is in Lerris!  Most expecially you!"

	"He won't stop for n-nothing!" Kera squealed.  "Mommy!  Daddy!  You have to go away!"

	"We're not leaving you, Kera!"  Pilate shouted in a determined voice.  "Don't you fret!  Your mother and father will be right th—"

	"Pilate."

	The zebra's ears tilted back towards Bellesmith.  His name had barely been whispered against the cocophony.  Both mates knew that only he could hear it.

	With a neutral expression she said, "We cannot feed it anymore."

	Pilate clenched his jaw tight.

	"I know it will hurt her," Belle said.

	Pilate hung his head.  Then, after a heavy breath, he lunged forward, gripping the doorframe to steady himself.  "Nnnnngh—Kera!"

	"D-Daddy?!" Kera yelped above the noise.

	"Kera, they're dead!"

	The little foal's eyes popped wide—glowing.

	The zebra struggled to shout, "Mommy and Daddy are dead!"  He took the blow of a book slapping across his metal plate and grunted, "They died years ago, Kera!  You couldn't save them any more than you could save Lerris!  But none of it was your fault!"  He barely dodged a desk lamp flinging past his skull.  "And you know what?!  You overcame that tragedy!  Your strength and charisma carried you out of that pit and brought you into our arms!  Me!  Pilate!  My beloved!  Belle!  You came to us and you saved us!"

	Kera hyperventilated, lips trembling. "But... b-but..."  She gulped.  "Mom... Dad... th-they... th-they..."

	"They're gone.  But you're not!  And neither are us!" Pilate hollered.  "Kera, please!"  He clawed across the floor with his forelimbs and tugged himself towards her with Belle in tow.  "Come back to us!  We need you!  We need the brave little filly again!"

	"I... I-I can't..."

	"Nothing hurts more than knowing how helpless one can be!" Pilate shouted.  "But listen to me!  Trust me!  There is strength on the other side!  You just have to be brave enough to cross it!  Nopony else can bridge it for you!  Don't stay alone in the dark where our love can only barely reach you!"

	"Just... just feel so..."  Kera's teeth gnashed.  "So... so..."

	Pilate nodded.  "I feel angry too!  And sad!"  Pilate stretched a hoof out.  "Welcome to the club, precious.  Induction is the worst and most painful part..."

	Kera's body shook, quivered, and heaved.  With a low pitched roar at first, then ascending into a violent wail, she yelled for a good twenty seconds.  Every floating bit of debris flew outwards like particles from an exploding atom, colliding with the walls and falling limply to the floor as the green pulsing manastorm finally ended.

	All was silent, save for Kera's quiet sobs.

	Gathering his b
