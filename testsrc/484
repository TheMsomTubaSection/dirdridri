  Can you understand that?!"

	"Loud and clear, Rainbow!" Rayvinne stammered, wincing against the rising winds.  "Things are about to g-get real, aren't they?"

	"Way ahead of yourself, girl!"  Rainbow gripped the front of the cloud tighter.  "Okay!  Sivrem, beat your wings hard!"

	"Rrrgghhhh—like... so...?!"

	"Harder!  Kitsune, get ready to compensate!  Rayvinne and Jagold!  Keep up the pace!  Everypony hold tight, now!  Things are about to get jumpy—"

	A rising gust of air send the cloud flouncing skyward in a savage jolt.

	"Guhh!" Smythe wheezed, nearly slipping.

	"We're good!  We're good!" Rainbow exclaimed.  "That's just the start!"

	"Just the st-start?!" Jagold chirped.

	"Concentrate on beating your wings!" Kitsune shouted.  "Rainbow, I feel us teetering to the left!"

	"I know!  I'm guiding us along an air pocket!  Just wait for my command!"

	"Valkyrie's Shout..."  Smythe stammered.  "This was a bad idea..."

	"Listen for Rainbow Dash," Jerrio said.

	"Okay!  Kitsune!  Beat your wings harder!  Sivrem, give some slack!"

	"Aack!" Jagold yelped.  "We're falling!"

	"It's called gliding, girl," Rayvinne hissed through a smirk.  "Just relax!"

	"Heheheheheheh..."  Sivrem grinned wide as the entire cloud shook and flounced.

	Kitsune squinted across the bed.  "You're enjoying this waaay too much."

	"If only you knew how many times I tried this on my own," Sivrem said, smirking.

	"I do."

	"This is incredible..."

	"Keep your head in the game, guys!" Rainbow shouted, squinting over the front of the cloud.  "Okay!  Here c-comes the rough part!  Jerrio!  Smythe!  Beat your wings, give us lift!"

	"On it!"

	"Rggggghhh!"

	"Everypony in the rear, angle your wings out!  And hang on!  This is about to get kaizo!"

	As Rainbow said that, the cloud lifted up, almost mimicking the jutting angles of the sky stabs below.  The compacted mists ascended rapidly, swaying left and right as it surfed an air current.  Then, just as the cloud settled still in mid-air...

	"And... Stop, Smythe and Jerrio!"  Rainbow glance over her shoulder.  "Kitsune!  Sivrem!  Give us lift!"

	The First-Borns did so, forcing the rear of the cloud to raise while the tip tilted downward.

	"Jagold!  Rayvinne!  Now you guys!"

	The cloud tilted even more.

	"Everypony... hold!"

	All of the wings stopped beating.  The air howled as the cloud sliced its way forward, shook slightly, then began a maddening plunge.

	"Eggshells—" Smythe began.

	"Everyone!" Rainbow shouted, clutching the front of the cloud as she angled her wings back.  "Wings spread!  Glide!  Glide!"

	"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww crud!" Rayvinne squeaked while she and the rest complied.

	The cloud began a rapid descent, soaring down the southern faces of the Sky Stabs.  Waves of mist and fog parted ways as the ponies slid on through them.  They could hear the pounding of blood in their ears as they approached maximum velocity.

	"This is faaa-aaaa-aaast!" Jagold whimpered.

	"Woooooo-hooooo!" Sivrem grinned.  "Ha haaa!"

	"It's not over yet!" Rainbow hollered.  "We need more lift on the left side!  Smythe...!"  Silence.  She glanced back.  "Smythe?!"

	"Nnnngh... c-can't..."  The stallion wheezed, slipping.  "C-can't hang on!"

	Rainbow gasped.  "Smythe!"

	"Gaaaaaah!"  The stallion lost his grip.  He toppeled backwards like a loose boulder—

	"Hnntttt!"  Jerrio lunged out, grasping the loose stallion by his tail.

	The Durandanans in the back gasped.

	Gritting his teeth, Jerrio strained against the murderous winds and body-pressed Smythe back into the cloud bed, holding him down with his weight.

	Rainbow lunged in reverse, planted herself in the middle of the cloud, and spread her wings high.  "Gnnnrrnnnghhh-guhhhh!"  Compensating for Jerrio and Smythe, she managed to catch enough air in her feathers to force the cloud into an upward tilt.  The bottom of the cloudbed absorbed the friction, and the compacted mist thinned all throughout.  The cloud stretched broader, wider.

	"It's... it's b
