	"... ... ..."

	"It... erm... was exceedingly amusing to me at the time."

	"Maybe we should go downstairs where it's closer to the lavatory or some other place where I could vomit."

	"Agreed."

	Ebon Mane tossed and turned.  No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get comfortable enough in his cot.  Even with all the blankets bundled around him to ward off the chill of the Jury's high altitude climb, he remained restless.

	With a groan, he sat up, rubbing his eyes with a burgundy hoof.  Staring blearily across the dimly-lit compartment, Ebon groaned and plopped down onto all four legs.  He opened the valve and shuffled out into the narrow corridor outside.  Once there, he looked down towards the bow.  Emptiness hung with shadows and more shadows.  He turned and looked towards the mess hall—

	Eagle Eye's slender frame was obstructing the light from the lounge.

	Ebon did a double-take.  Blinking hard, he shuffled down the passage.  "Eagle Eye?"

	No response.  The ex-mercenary stared gloomily into the bulkheads.

	"EE?"

	Finally, Eagle twitched.  He glanced up.  At first sight of Ebon, his features softened and he breathed, "Ebon?  You're up."

	"Yeah..."  The cook nodded, shuffling to a stop before the other stallion.  "Seems to be contagious."

	Eagle fidgeted.  "Yes, well..."  He glanced down at the floor.  "I couldn't fall asleep."

	Ebon leaned his head aside.  "Too busy thinking about what awaits us in the crater?"

	"Uhhhh..."  Eagle brushed at his silken bangs.  He blinked and grinned mechanically.  "Yes!  That's... uh... that's it!"  A dry chuckle.  "Fear of death and gloom and spontaneous village murders!"

	Ebon raised an eyebrow.

	Eagle gulped.  "Also some indigestion."  He bit his lip. "Just a little."

	"For real?"  Ebon leaned in and placed his fuzzy ear straight up against Eagle's side.  "Oh jeez!  I hope it wasn't because of what I cooked!"

	"Uhhhh... buhhhh..."  Eagle flushed deep red and gently pulled Ebon back up into a standing position.  "Nah!  It's... it's fine!"

	"Eagle, I'm a little worried about you."

	"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh..."  Eagle grinned.  "Why?"

	"Well..."  Ebon's brow furrowed.  "You seem so... preoccupied lately."

	"Isn't everypony?"

	"Honestly, no.  Not really."  Ebon shook his head.  "Ever since Abinadi, we've been really chill."

	"We h-have?"

	"Yeah.  Even Roarke is starting to come out of her shell.  Haven't you noticed?"

	"Well... uhm... I-I guess I'm just not used to being... er... weaponless!"

	Ebon's eyebrows were flat.  "Weaponless..."

	"Yeah!  I lost my sword in Stratopolis!  And my shield is practically garbage now!  Why, back in Foxtaur, I used to practice with my sword every morning, noon, and evening!  It got my mind relaxed.  Heh... although Zenith used to say I'd go blind sooner than later."

	"... ... ..."

	"Eh..."  Eagle Eye avoided Ebon's mane.  "I guess that's only a joke that the old stallion would laugh at."

	"Eagle..."  Ebon leaned forward, speaking within a warm whisper's distance.  "If... if s-something was troubling you, you'd tell me wouldn't you?"

	"Oh, t-totally!  I mean... why wouldn't I?"

	"Because I think... that is..."  Ebon exhaled quietly and murmured, "We have something special, don't we?"

	Eagle stared back.  He simply smiled.

	Ebon's eyes wandered into the shadows.  Suddenly, his lips curved.  "You know..."  He leaned in again.  "If you're having trouble sleeping in your quarters... you c-could always try mine."

	Eagle blinked.

	"I mean... at th-this point..."  Ebon played with his mane and giggled aside.  "Why not?"

	"Heh... heheheh..."  Eagle wheezed through a crooked smile.  "Yeah, why n—"  He suddenly flew forward and collapsed into Ebon.

	"Gaaaah!"  Ebon fell hard to the floor, his legs tangled up with Eagle's.  "I-I didn't m-mean like th-that!"

	"It w-wasn't me!  I sw-swear!" Eagle stammered, struggling to disentangle hi
