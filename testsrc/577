 glint of metal.

	CLANG!  The shield uppercutted Josho.

	"Augh!"  He fell back on his fat flank, sliding to a stop against the engine room's doorframe.

	"Don't follow me, old stallion!"  Eagle Eye snarled.  He opened the door—but lingered slightly.  A tiny whimper escaped his lips.  Fidgeting, he spat out, "I-I'm sorry..." Then darted into the hangar, locking the door behind him.

	"What... in the bl-blue bucking blazes?!"  Josho struggled and struggled to get up.

	The door to the engine room hissed open.  Props and Zaid spilled out.

	"JJ!" Props gasped.

	"Whoah there, roly poly!"  Zaid reached down with two hooves.  "If you're gonna try pulling off that crap, try it in the shower!"

	"This ain't no laughing matter, bozo!" Josho lurched up onto his hooves, wincing.  "Eagle Eye's leaving!"

	"He's leaving?!" Props gasped.  "What for?!"

	"I dunno, but he just went through me to do it!"

	Hoofsteps echoed across the stairwell.  Within a blink, Kera galloped to the bottom level, followed by a breathless Bellesmith and Pilate.

	"Hey!  Hey!  Everypony!"  Kera skidded to a stop.  "Did you see Eagle Eye just now?!"

	"No, but my chins did," Josho grumbled.

	"Kera saw him rushing across the mess hall!" Belle said.  "It looked like he had Ebon Mane on his back."

	"He had something on his back alright," Josho grumbled.  "But it sure as Hell wasn't Ebon."

	"What on earth could you mean by that?" Pilate asked.

	"Nnngh!"  Props was shoving against the door to the infirmary.  "Hey guys!  Mr. Adoracutes locked us out!"

	"He did not!"  Zaid brushed Props aside and threw his shoulder into the door.  "Nnnngh!"  He leaned back, panting.  "Holy hoofjobs, he did!"

	Just then, the entire ship shook.  Everypony could hear the metal rattle of hydraulic door parts moving through the bulkheads.

	"What in heaven's name is going on here?!" Belle exclaimed.

	"If I didn't know better, I'd say the hangar door was opening," Pilate stammered.

	Everypony looked at one another.

	"Blessed Spark," Belle gasped.  "Top deck!"

	Kera was the first to scamper up the stairs.  Everypony swiftly followed suit.



	"What in the spit is happening to Nancy Jane now?!" Floydien shouted from the cockpit.

	"Feels like a release of pressure!" Booster Spice exclaimed.  "Does this ship have opening compartments?"

	"Yes yes yes!  In the rear!"

	"Then I think somepony's just opened it!" Booster exclaimed.  His ears twitched to the sound of galloping hooves.  He spun towards the stairwell.

	The Jurists charged out, catching their breaths in the dim starlight.

	"Anypony seen Eagle Eye?!" Kera asked.

	"Who?!"

	"The cute girl," Josho grumbled.

	"You mean the blonde with the awesome goggles?"

	"No, the cuter one!" Props chirped

	Booster squinted.  "The lavender unicorn?"

	"That one!"

	"I haven't seen anypony come up here until you guys just—"

	"Don't be silly!" Belle shouted, rushing towards the starboard railing.  "Look towards the ground!  They'll have touched down by now!"

	"They?!"

	"Eagle Eye and Ebon!" Josho shouted, peering past the opened hangar doors at the stern.  "They just jumped ship, and I'm willing to bet Princess used his magic!"

	"Why in the spit would lover boomers jump ship?!"

	"Just look for them, okay?!  They can't have gone far!"

	"Searching... searching..."  Zaid squinted across the forest.  "Reticulating splines..."

	"Zaidy Waidy, less mouthing and more squinting."

	"There!" Kera's voice cracked from the port side.

	"Kera?" Pilate stammered as ponies galloped past him.

	"Where?!  Where?!"  Props bounced.

	"Down there!  Look!" Kera pointed.

	Every Jurist spotted two shapes galloping through the forest with a green glow.

	"Wait..."  Zaid blinked.  "Doesn't EE's horn glow violet?"

	"That's... n-not his horn," Josho murmured.

	"Then if it's not his horn that's glowing, what's—?" Pilate began but didn't finish.  His ears folded and he tilted his face across the Jury.

	Bellesmith blinked at him.  Ultimatel
