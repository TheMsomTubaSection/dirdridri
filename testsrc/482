for the trip beyond the greens."

	"What do you mean we?" Smythe asked.

	Jagold gasped.  "You're coming along too?!"

	Jerrio glanced calmly aside.  "But of course.  You're going to need somepony responsible to make sure this goes off without any problems."

	Sivrem squinted.  "You mean we're going to need somepony to report every damn detail to the Gray Feathers like the pigeon-tailed sissy he is."

	"Mmmmm... yes."  Jerrio's muzzle curved ever so slightly.  "Something to that extent."

	"I thought as much."  Sivrem turned to Rainbow Dash, sighing with a tired smile.  "I believe we're a go."

	"Groovy!"

	"Erm..."  Smythe fidgeted.  "Just how is this going to work?"

	"The key is not to think that the cloud is an object," Rainbow said.  "But—instead—a piece of ourselves.  I mean... we built it."

	"You built it," Kitsune said.

	Rainbow stuck her tongue out.  "A maiden voyage is best led by the maiden herself."

	"Do you seriously believe that?" Rayvinne asked.

	"I do now.  Alright, everypony.  Spread out."

	"In what way...?"

	"There's only seven of us, and we need to get this cloud moving against the wind.  So... four in the back.  two in the center.  I'll take point."

	"Huh?"

	"What I mean is that I'll be up front.  Now—for the ponies in the back—we want the outside wingponies to be the strongest."

	"Guess that means Sivrem and Kitsune."

	"Hrmmm..."  Jerrio murmured to himself.

	Sivrem smirked.  "Would you like to say something, First-Born?"

	"I'll take the middle with Smythe."

	"Hey!"  Jagold frowned.  "I'm not that weak!"

	Rayvinne glided past her, murmuring in her ear.  "Yes you are."

	"Ohhhh..." Jagold melodically sighed, following the other mare.  "I guess you're right."

	"Alright!" Kitsune sounded off from the rear of the cloud.  "We're in position!"

	"Are we doing what I think we're doing?!" Smythe remarked.

	"Yup!"  Rainbow took her spot at the very front of the cloud.  The group formed a triangular "V" that fanned out towards the rear.  "On my mark, you're going to start beating your wings.  I'll get our position started, and then when I shout 'left,' I want Smythe and Kitsune to angle us towards the right.  When I shout 'right,' I want Jerrio and Sivrem to angle us to the left!  Got it?"

	"I... th-think so?"

	"Once we get enough momentum, the cloud will pretty much carry itself!"

	"What about ascending—"

	"I'll take care of it!  What's more, I'll show you how it's done when the time comes!  Just trust me!"

	"Uh... sure thing..."

	"Alright, everypony!"  Rainbow Dash raised her hoof.  "Southbound Express for Beyond the Greens!  Let's roll!"



	Across the deck of the Noble Jury, several ponies stood, watching with baited breath.  Before their eyes, the angular cloud picked up speed and started cruising its way south.

	"It's moving!"  Kera squeaked, hopping up and down across Bellesmith's back.  "It's moving!"

	"Absolutely remarkable," Belle murmured, a soft grin plastered across her muzzle.  She brushed shoulders with Pilate.  "Beloved, I wish you could see this."

	"Hmmm..."  The zebra smiled.  "I can hear it just fine."

	Belle squinted at him.  "But... it's not making any noise."

	"I know, and that's the beauty of it."  He chuckled.  "Imagine, a vehicle built by clouds... powered by ponies alone."

	"Winged ponies, you mean," Propsy said.

	"Well, true."

	"I wonder why we've never seen Rainbow do something like this before," Eagle murmured from where he stood with Ebon.

	"Maybe you haven't, EE," Belle said with a smile.  "But Pilate and I have witnessed Rainbow do some cloudplay in our day."

	"I've seen her do it," Zaid said with a proud smirk.

	Props blinked up at him.  "You have?"

	"Heck yeah!"  He hung a forelimb around her shoulder.  "It's how the Terrific Trio snuck aboard the Lightning Bearer!  Pegasus Cloud Power!  Yeah!"

	Josho raised an eyebrow.  "'Terrific Trio?'"

	"Yup!  Me, Rainbow Kickass, and Roarke Most Rawwwwr."

	"Hmmm..."  Josho smirked.  "'More like
