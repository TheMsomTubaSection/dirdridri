mbs against her chest, feeling the rattle of her pendant with each pent-up sob.

	"Celestia... Celestia, I-I can't..."  She whimpered, her teeth gnashing beneath clenched eyes.  "Not anymore... I don't know how... I-I don't know..."  She moaned into her forelimbs.  "Why am I here?  Why am I even h-here?  It doesn't... d-doesn't..."

	Her words trailed off, and yet she heard an echo to the sobs.

	Sniffling, Rainbow rubbed her cheeks dry and opened her puffy eyes.

	The sobbing continued, this time at a distance.  To Rainbow's twitching ears, it sounded like it was just around the corner.

	Gulping, Rainbow stood up on weak hooves.  Pensively, she trotted around the bend, following the melancholic noise.  A tiny torch flickered into her eyes.  She squinted, her face scrunching at a terrible stench.  She heard the buzzing of flies and the rattle of chains.

	At last, Rainbow came completely around the corner.  A dark shape lay beneath her, but it was too solid to be a shadow.

	Fettered to the wall, surrounded by its own filth, an emaciated changeling sat in shackles. Sobbing, it looked up at Rainbow Dash.  In a brief moment, its green eyes turned to ruby pupils and back again.  "Please... I-I'm sorry," the changeling whimpered.  "Just stop... st-stop waving it in front of me..."

	"What..."  Rainbow squinted, her sorrow replaced by shock and confusion.  "...the buck?"

	"So much love..."  The changeling's flesh turned blue and fuzzy and went back to its black shell.  It curled over, clutching its chest as it avoided Rainbow's gaze.  "It's too much.  It hurts... h-hurts to hunger..."

	Rainbow sat down across the wretched creature, her eyes glued to its chains, then to the green bloodstains along the brick wall surrounding it.  "What... how...?"

	"Please tell her I-I'm sorry," the creature sobbed.

	Rainbow cocked her head aside.  "Tell who?"

	"Mother..."  The changeling hissed.  "Mother, I'm s-so sorry for hungering..."

	"What... I mean..."  Rainbow Dash slinked forward on trembling hooves, her thin eyes studying the injured changeling up and down.  "Why are you here?  Who did all of this to youâ€”"

	"N-no!"  The changeling slid back on rattling chains.  "Mother d-doesn't... nnnnghhh... d-doesn't approve!"

	"Approve of what?!"

	"No love... positively none..."  The changeling shook its head, stifling a sob.  "If I feed... I'll connect to Mother... and th-they'll find her..."

	"Who...?"  Rainbow Dash leaned forward.  "And who's this 'Mother?'"

	"Please... I'm so sorry..."  The changeling gripped its skull, shivering.  "No more.  I-I can't..."

	"Look, will you just chillax?  I simply wanna understand more."  Rainbow tried a weak smile.  "I'm not going to hurt you."

	The changeling spoke with a muffled tone.  "How can I believe that..."  A flash of green flame.  An orange face with freckles gazed up at Rainbow.  "...when all you do is hurt yourself, sugarcube?"

	Rainbow's eyes went wide as saucers.  She scuttled backwards on jittery hooves, bumping into a large body.  With a gasp, she jerked and looked up.

	Josho braced himself with a hoof on her shoulder, grimacing at the creature.  "What in Ledo's wide-wide hips is this shit?!"

	"Forgive me!" the changeling wailed.  Its face turned lavender with flowing locks of silken hair as it reeled away from the stallion.  "Too much love!  All I do is taste!  Mother, I'm so sorry!"

	"I... I-I just found him... her... it like this!" Rainbow sputtered.  "It keeps rambling on about 'Mother' and how 'sorry it is' for wanting to 'feed on love!'"

	"Dayum thing looks wasted," Josho exclaimed.  He squinted at the miserable creature.  "Are those... bloodstains on the wall?"

	"The nasty little wretches have a terrible habit of leaking," droned a voice.  Josho and Rainbow spun to see Seclorum standing cooly in the bend of the corridor.  Aatxe leaned awkwardly against a wall behind him, avoiding the sight of the ghastly crea
