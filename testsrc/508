lung a forelimb around Ebon Mane as she grinned proudly.  "Want Ebony here to cook you up some love grub?  Bet you're hungry after all... that... exercise..."

	Rainbow Dash trotted briskly past them.

	Props blinked curiously at her.  "Uhhhhhhh..."

	Ebon winced, whispering in Props' ear.  "Maybe the honeymoon went south?"

	"How come?"  Props whispered back.  "Do Rainbow and Roarke have mountain ice melting in the north?"

	"Uhhhh... hi there... Rain...bow?"  Eagle Eye waved weakly as the pegasus marched past him.

	She nearly plowed over Pilate and Bellesmith as the two approached the lower door of the stairwell.  They witnessed quietly as Rainbow opened the hatch to the engine room door and made her way through.

	"That's... rather odd," Belle said.

	"Did Rainbow just walk past us?"

	"And how."  Belle nodded.  "If only you could see the look on her face."

	"Angry?  Sad?"

	"Just... blank."

	"Well, this may be a side of Rainbow we don't know."

	"How do you mean?"

	"Shhhh..."  Pilate hissed.  "I smell metal..."

	Right at that precise moment, Roarke shuffled up.  Unlike Rainbow, she came to a stop, fidgeting, but not quite looking at either of the two beloveds.

	"Roarke... how is... I mean... erm..."  Belle fumbled for words.  "Oh dear..."

	"Is everything alright, Roarke?" Pilate asked.

	Roarke clenched her teeth, but nevertheless her voice carried through.  "I... d-don't know," she said in a strangely quiet tone.

	"Roarke..."  Belle smiled.  "As you well know, it's a tiny ship."  She suppressed a giggle.  "Please don't give us the awkward task of finding out on our own."

	"I... I..."  Roarke squirmed where she stood.  Her muzzle contorted.  Slowly—like a bending tree—she turned towards the two.  "I think th-there may be something wrong with her."

	"In what way?" Pilate asked.

	"It... I don't..."  Roarke bit her lip.  Clearing her throat, she took one bold step towards the two, her head tilted downward.  "If there was a way... anyway that... th-that..."

	"Roarke..."  Belle trotted forward and clasped one of the mare's hooves with her own.  She smiled into the pony's lenses.  "We would be more than happy to help."

	Roarke said nothing.  Slowly, gently, she just nodded.

	"You can stay by our side if you like," Belle added.

	Roarke gulped and said in a raspy tone:  "Indeed."

	"Come on."  Belle motioned with her head.  "I bet she's in her hammock by now."

	"I beg to differ," Pilate said as she followed the two into the engine room.

	"Huh?"  Belle glanced back.  "What makes you say that?"

	The zebra's ears twitched.  "Can't you hear the rustling of paper?"



	Rainbow's hooves rummaged throughout the interior of the navigation room.  She yanked books off shelves, flung folders open, and searched through every drawer.

	"Come on... come on..."

	Not for one second did she cease tearing the place apart.

	"Come on come on come on!"  She hissed at herself.  "I just need a blank sheet!  Any sheet!  Yes!"  At last, she stumbled upon a rolled-up map with a pure white back to it.  She spread the thing open on the desk and squatted before it.  Feeling around the table, she yanked a pen loose, dipped it in an ink well, and began drawing with her map.

	She was about halfway done when Roarke, Belle, and Pilate showed up.  Not long after, Props, Eagle Eye, and Ebon Mane stuck their heads through the engine room door.

	Roarke leaned in towards Belle and Pilate.  "She's been... mmmm... obsessing with a strange symbol all morning."

	Belle leaned towards her.  "Was this before or after the—"

	Roarke glared.

	"Ahem.  Right."  Belle leaned back.  "Let's just... see what becomes of this."

	"I can hear you guys," Rainbow droned while in mid-sketch.  "And if that's Roarke's tense breaths I hear right next to you, just tell her to relax.  I'm not crazy.  I swear."

	Everypony glanced at Roarke, who then glanced at the bulkheads, frowning.  Clearing her throat, Props shuffled up.  "Uhhh... whatcha drawin', Dashie?"

	"That's what
