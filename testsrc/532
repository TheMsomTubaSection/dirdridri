Rainbow to the ground as the former encampment exploded around them.  Bursts of fire lit the mists up with a necrotic green hue.

	The creature surged overhead.  It passed by far faster than Rainbow could have guessed.

	"Dammit!"  Josho stood back up.  "Can't get a clear shot!"

	"She's too fast..."  Rainbow stood up, panting.  "And small."

	"Huh?!"  Josho flashed her a sweaty look.

	Rainbow was shivering.  "And her breath isn't the same color as her inner shell."  Rainbow nevertheless stared at the mutated dragon as it flew off on a bending course.  "It... it's not her..."

	"What?!"  Josho cackled.  "You... you mean..."  He turned to gawk at the rampaging creature.  "You mean to friggin' tell me that there are two mutated chaos dragons on this goddess-forsaken plane?!"

	"I don't know..."

	"There's another Divine with two mouths and antlers and—?!"

	"I don't know, Josho.  Dang it!  I don't know!"  Rainbow shouted.  "Maybe Nevlamas hatched babies or something!  I just don't friggin' know!"  She began hyperventilating.

	"This is bad... this is very, very bad."  Josho peered over the sight of his shotgun.  "If that monster that Chrysalis and the Xonans used to wreck Seclorum's camp had a dayum brood, then we're all doomed."  He grunted to himself.  "Rainbow, we gotta find the others."  Silence, save for the distant shouts of stallions.  "Rainbow?"  He turned and gasped.

	Rainbow had collapsed to the ground, overcome with shivers.

	"Oh, for Pete's sake... Rainbow!"  Josho ran to her side and shook her.  "Stay with the program, Speedy!  We need you!  Nopony's faced Nevlamas like you have!  Stay with me!"

	"I... I-I can't..."  Rainbow wheezed, her pupils turning blood red.  She whimped and clutched her rattling pendant.  "The chaos... it's... I-I can taste it..."

	"I got a fix!" Booster Spice shouted.  "It's now or never, Drakshaa!"

	"It's... it's not going to work!" Rainbow hissed.  Her eyes flickered again and again.  "Tell them!  She's too strong!  Her brood..."

	Josho spun and hollered.  "Guys!  Save your javelin!  We gotta get out of here!  This is beyond us!"

	"Shut up!" Drakshaa hollered back.  "We're ending this!  Here and now!"

	"Come on, ya idiot silver hicks!" Josho snarled.  "Learn from the experts!  We can't beat this thing!  We gotta—"

	"Fire!" Booster shouted.

	"Josho—!"

	"Rainbow, keep your head down!"

	A black iron barb flew low overhead.  The air howled.  Rainbow tossed her head aside, squinting.

	With her last thread of vision, she caught the javelin slicing through the air.  It met the antler'd dragon head-on.  But then something else happened, something foggier than the mists surrounding them.  Rainbow wasn't certain, but for a brief blink it appeared as though the creature split into two—completely dodging the projectile altogether.  Where the two halves went, she couldn't see, for all was turning into darkness.

	Rainbow wept quietly into the dizzy beyond, and was out like a light.

	"Mmmmff... grnnngh..."  Rainbow Dash stirred and stirred, clutching her fuzzy muzzle with a pair of shivering hooves.  "Nnngh... n-no... no... she's gone... I saw her... I-I watched her die..."  She gnashed her teeth and turned over in the grass, wincing.  "Axan, you took her... you took her body away... and her soul..."

	"Rainbow..."

	"Why d-didn't you tell me that there was more to it?" Rainbow hissed.  "I helped slay her.  Do I have to slay her hatchlings as well?"

	"Rainbow, there's nothing left to slay."  A brown hoof caressed Rainbow's cheek.  "The dragon's gone."

	Rainbow's eyes flashed opened.  There was a red-on-yellow flash, and then they glistened normally.  She tried sitting up, only to succumb to a wave of dizziness.  "Unnngh—"

	Roarke steadied the mare, squatting at her side.  Behind her, the ponies of Amulek stumbled through the mists, collecting in a weary pile of bruised bodies beside the smoldering remains of their
