€™d need the eyes of a dragonfly to read you.â€

    â€œAnd machete for a bookmark, yes yes?â€

    â€œWhoah!  I wasnâ€™t calling you dense or nothing.â€

    â€œSurely color wheel can spit for humor.â€  Floydien gestured his antlers towards the pale stallion.  â€œWhatâ€™s with the bearded boomer?â€

    â€œPropsâ€™ Uncle Prowse.  The one we saved earlier today?  Oh, and the turtle too.â€

    â€œAt this rate, Nancy Janeâ€™s going to get fat.â€

    â€œYeah.  Sorry about that, dude.â€  Rainbow glanced at the elk.  â€œI dunno what the future holds for Prowse, but Elma there has a home in some place called Alafreo.  Itâ€™s on the far side of the Strip of Flurries.â€

    â€œSo Nancyâ€™s going to drop a turtle, then?â€

    Rainbow sighed.  â€œYes, Floydien.  Yes, she will.â€

    â€œFloydien doesnâ€™t care, so long as shelled boomer cleans after herself in the meantime.â€

    â€œIâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™sâ€¦ ermâ€¦ sh-shell trained.â€

    â€œMore boomers look like they could use the thwack thwack.â€

    â€œHmmm?â€ Rainbow glanced curiously at him.

    He pointed a cloven hoof across the room.

    Rainbow squinted.

    Belle sat with Kera.  The mare was far away from the happily chatting group, seated on one of the sofa cushions.  She brushed the dormant fillyâ€™s mane with loving strokes.  Not long after, a frail shadow shuffled in.  Pilate strolled into the mess hall from the long narrow hallway beyond.  Feeling about, he gradually made his way to the chairs across from the couch.

    Belle took a deep breath.  Without looking--or even saying a thing--she gently propped Kera on her shoulders, stood up, and walked quietly down the hallway from which Pilate came.

    The zebra froze, his ears flicking to the sounds of dainty hoofsteps.  After a while, he sighed, then continued shuffling forward, making his way towards the kitchen.

    Rainbow Dash bit her lip as her eyes tensed.

    The elk leaned his muzzle towards her ear.  â€œAnd color wheel boomer thought Floydien was reclusive.â€  With a snort, he shuffled off to the far end of the room, leaving her alone with her flapping wings.

    Rubbing her muzzle in thought, Rainbow Dash stared out the nearby porthole, noticing the sunset glistening off the frozen waters.



    Hours later, Belle lay in the darkness, wide awake.  She cradled Keraâ€™s sleeping figure in her forelimbs, stroking the fillyâ€™s shoulders every now and then.  Her moist chestnut eyes gazed into the bulkhead on the edge of the cot. 

    Somewhere in the midst of this perpetual malaise, the intercom inside the room crackled.

    â€Scrkkkk!  Chestnut boomer.  Floydien needs her ears to rise rise.â€

    Belleâ€™s jaws clenched tight.  She remained where she was.

    â€Crkkkkk!  Chestnut boomerâ€¦ It will spit on and on into the night with greater volume.â€

    â€œNnnnnnnghâ€¦â€  With a low growl, Belle rose out of bed and slapped her hoof over the intercom.  â€œMr. Floydien, you caught me at a bad time--â€

    â€œThe boomeretteâ€™s time is always bad.  If only Nancy Janeâ€™s spirit could infect all estrogenicon, yes yes?â€

    â€œUhhhhâ€¦â€

    â€Floydien assures chestnut boomer that this is a matter of extreme importport.  Nancy Janeâ€™s guide will freeze out here if she waits any longer.â€

    Belle blinked.  â€œRainbow Dashâ€¦?â€

    â€Donâ€™t make Floydien come down there.  These antlers arenâ€™t filly-proof, no no. Scrkkk!â€

    Belle fidgeted, shook, then sighed.  Hanging her head, she stood in a slump besides the bed, then relented with a defeated groan.  She leaned towards the bed, drew a blanket over Keraâ€™s slumbering figure, and gave the filly a gentle nuzzle.  Fighting back the urge to sniffle, Belle slipped on her leather coat and trotted out of the tiny compartment, shutting the door quietly behind her.



    Belle climbed up the vertical crawlspace and emerged inside the cockpit.  A dim amber light lit the top deck under the black fabric of night.

    â€œAlright, Mr. F
