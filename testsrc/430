ng the shots here.  But, really, I think they're totally qualified for the leadership thingy."  She turned back.  "I bet you're really proud to fly alongside them everyday—Mmmmmff!"

	Rayvinne's muzzle was clamped tightly over Rainbow's.

	Eyes bulging, Rainbow yanked her neck back, disentangling her lips from Rayvinne's with a comical pop!.  "Whoah... whoahhhhhhhh-ho-ho-ho..."  She stretched her hooves out, bracing Rayvinne's shoulders.  "Heh... I like your style, girl, but—for real—it's all about the landing!"

	"I agree."  Rayvinne grinned, her eyes thin.  "Your nest or mine?"

	"Buh?"

	"You wanna land?"  The pegasus purred, nuzzling one of Rainbow's forelimbs.  "I've got a place for that.  And then, right after, I can show you what it truly means to fly."

	Rainbow stared, her jaw dropped.  "Uhhhh... ahem... uhhh..."  She wrenched her eyes away, grinning stupidly as her cheeks caught aflame.  "Not th-that... that doesn't seem like a really swell invitation or anything..."

	"Hmmmm..."  Rayvinne nuzzled her cheek up the length of Rainbow's leg.  "Who's inviting?"

	Rainbow blinked.  "Look, no..."

	"It's not that long of a flight—"

	"I'm sorry, but no, okay?"  Rainbow yanked her leg out of Rayvinne's grip.  "I'm flattered.  And..."  She winced.  "Damn if you aren't hot as Tartarus, but... I can't..."

	Rayvinne pouted, pink eyes glittering.  "You can't?"

	"I won't," Rainbow said.  Her frown was a brief, brief thing, swallowed up by a sigh as she ran a hoof through her bangs.  "Don't take it personally.  But... but it's just that... I'm not in a good place for—"

	"Hmmm..."  Rayvine leaned back with a knowing smirk.  "There's somepony else, isn't there?"

	Rainbow Dash bit her lip, staring at Rayvinne.  Eventually she murmured, "I... I-I don't really know..."  She gulped.  "But there might as well be."

	Rayvinne's wingtips fluttered.  "Well, have them join!"

	"HAH!"  Rainbow barked.  She tilted her head back, eyes rolling.  "HA HA!"  She exhaled long and slow.  "Whewwwwwww..."  A smirk.  "Go to bed, Rayvinne."

	"Hmmph.  Fine."  Rayvinne brushed past Rainbow, as did her feathers and feathers and feathers.  "But the moment you change your mind..."  She winked.  "I'll be waiting."  Then, with a heavy flap of her wings, she took off into the glittering night sky.

	Rainbow Dash stood there, watching her.  All the while, her ears twitched to a persistent rattling sound.  She realized it was her Loyalty Pendant rhythmically clattering with her intense heartbeat.  She pressed a hoof to the gem and steadied herself with a deep breath.

	"I hope you know," Fawful's voice remarked, descending from above.  "You just turned down the opportunity of a lifetime."

	Rainbow turned to glance at the elder.  "And just how would you know that?"

	Fawful smirked in the penumbra of distant lantern light.  "I haven't exactly been a Gray Feather for long."  She pointed in the direction where the other mare had just flown.  "And Rayvinne's older than she looks."

	"You can stop right there.  For real."  Rainbow gulped.  "Must be hard to 'protect scrolls' in a place like this with all of the... distractions."

	"Hmmmm..."  Fawful chuckled breathily.  "We Durandanans have more self-control than you think.  Especially when it matters."  She landed and pointed at the pegasus.  "So do you, it would seem."

	"That wasn't self-control," Rainbow muttered.  She then sighed, wings drooping.  "That was... something else."

	"Would you like to talk about it?"

	"No."

	"My apologies."

	"Nothing to be sorry about."  Rainbow glanced over.  She blinked calmly.  "However, you could talk to me about what the elders have decided."

	Fawful nodded.  "Yes.  Yes, I could..."

	"Well?"  Rainbow gulped.  "Is it good news or bad news?"

	Fawful gazed thoughtfully into the stars.  "Well..."  She gave Rainbow a faint smile.  "A little bit of both."
