”most of allâ€”snow and ice."

	Fawful blinked, her mouth agape.  "The frost demons," she murmured.  "The Valkyrie... b-banished their blight from the skies of Light."

	Rainbow chuckled.  "Heh... ya see?"  She smiled.  "Equestria and Durandana has more in common than you think."  She cleared her throat and tilted her hoof from side to side.  "Aside fromâ€”y'knowâ€”the messiah worship schtick."

	Fawful glanced up at Rainbow Dash.  She blinked.  "How do you think you factor in all of this, Rainbow?"

	"Huh?"

	Fawful reached forward and caressed the mare's mane.

	Rainbow's eyes followed the elder's hoof, then glanced back at Fawful.

	"You... you truly are a daughter of the Valkryie, aren't you?"  Fawful's jaw trembled.  "A First among First-Borns everywhere?"

	Rainbow exhaled calmly.  She grasped Fawful's hoof and held it between them while maintaining a gentle smile.  "Over the last year or so, I've been called many things.  Half of them I believe are bunk.  The other halfâ€”I don't really care.  All that matters to me is finding the strength to fly towards the next sunrise while remaining in one piece... and thenâ€”of courseâ€”to make sure the same goes for my friends."

	"But... but..."

	"Fawful, I am telling you... I am promising you... I didn't have any agenda for coming here.  Other than to find out the truth and share that truth."  She opened her mouth again, but lingered.

	Fawful took notice of it.

	After a sigh, Rainbow gazed towards the floor and muttered, "Guess that's not true.  There is another angle to it all."

	"And what's that?"

	"I... I couldn't pass this place up," Rainbow said.  "The moment I saw it... heard it... smelled it and tasted it..."  Rainbow shook her head, sniffled, and smiled weakly.  "I didn't think that after flying in one direction for so long th-that I'd somehow end up in a place like home.  At least not this early."  Rainbow gulped.  "The timing seems all too perfect, considering... well..."

	Fawful gazed at her worriedly.

	Rainbow cleared her throat and shook her head.  "But screw all that noise.  Your elders are stressing about it.  Why should we?"  Rainbow tilted her head up, bearing a brave smirk.  "So, tell me, Fawful..."

	"Tell you what?"

	"What does a girl in Central D do to party this time of night?"  Bright teeth.

	"You're pacing again," Pilate murmured.

	"I... I-I know, beloved," Bellesmith exhaled, trotting in wide circles across the top deck of the Noble Jury.  "I can't help it.  Don't you think they'd be back by now?"

	"Roarke is a mare who fully commits to what she does," Pilate said.  "I've no doubt that she had the entire day set aside for her exercises.  Even up to sundown."

	"Pilate.  It's almost an hour past sundown."

	"Perhaps there were some things she wished to test after the sun had set."

	"Shhh!"  Belle spun, gazing towards the horizon with a gaping expression.  "Did you hear that?"

	Pilate tilted his head, ears twitching.  "I don't hear anything, beloved."

	"Nnnnngh... I swear, I've been hearing explosions all day."

	"That would fall in line with the sort of things Roarke would be testing."

	"Pilate."  Belle frowned.  "I'm worried.  Aren't you?"

	The zebra slowly shook his head.  "Honestly, no."

	"Need I remind you that our little Kera is still out there with a former bounty hunter?"

	"I'd be more worried for Roarke at this point."

	"Ungh... Pilate..."

	"Well, think of it this way."  Pilate smirked.  "If she had spent the day out with Rainbow Dash instead, she'd probably have spelunked ten monster-filled caves by now."

	Belle ran a hoof through her chestnut bangs.  "Hmmm... you have a point there."

	Pilate shrugged.  "And if she had spent the day with Zaidâ€”"

	"Guh!  Don't go there!"

	"Heheheh..."

	"Speaking of Zaid, have you noticed how he and Props appear to beâ€”?"  Belle's words were cut off by the flapping of feathers.  She glanced up.
