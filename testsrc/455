 floor with folded ears.  He was dead silent, though his trembles were more than noticeable.

	"I... uhm..."  Eagle gulped.  "I-I don't know... what..."

	"May I step inside, Eagle, please?"  It was the gentlest of whispers.

	Eagle gawked.  He nod-nod-nodded and stepped aside, giving Ebon room to shuffle on in.  He very slowly, very gently closed the door behind them both.

	Ebon stared dead at the wall, his tail hanging limply behind him.  With a slight turn of the head, he murmured over his shoulder, "I was t-told that you would be here."

	"Uhm..."  Eagle Eye gulped the biggest lump ever down his throat.  "Yeah.  I mean... sure.  I guess..."

	"I... I was also told that you've been absolutely miserable."  Ebon's dry throat cleared.  "And from the way he described it, I... st-started to get concerned..."

	"Huh?"  Eagle blinked.  "Who?"

	"I know how dramatic you c-can sometimes be, Eagle."  Ebon twirled, eyes glossy as they finally found their mark, shaking Eagle to his core.  "The l-last thing I'd ever want for you is to hurt yourself!"

	"But... b-but I wouldn't!  I mean..."  Eagle's muzzle scrunched.  "Who gave you that idea—?!"

	"He loves you very much, you know," Ebon says.  "I... I don't blame him."

	Eagle blinked.  At last, he rolled his eyes and groaned inwardly.  "You dirty, dirty old stallion..."

	"Eagle Eye, please hear me out—"

	"Look."  Eagle sighed, trotting forward and waving a forelimb.  "Whatever Josho said, I'm sure it's just him trying to—"

	"No."  Ebon's bergundy hooves gently clasped either side of Eagle's leg and squeezed tight.  He gazed up into the other stallion's eyes.  "This is about me and you."  He gulped.  "It's always about me and you."

	"Ebon...?"

	Ebon sniffled, his eyes tearing up.  "You've been so good to me... so loving... so... adoring."  Ebon gritted his teeth.  "Everything in my being is telling me not to do this.  But... b-but I can't help it, Eagle.  I have to tell you..."

	Eagle took a deep, deep breath.  "Tell me what, Ebon?"

	"The tr-truth, Eagle," Ebon whimpered, his lips quivering.  "The truth about me."

	Eagle Eye nodded.  He smiled gently, a tear running down his muzzle.  He raised his other hoof and clasped it with Ebon's.  "I'm all ears..."

	"Back in Gray Smoke, I told you that I had no memories," Ebon Mane said as he trotted a tiny circle inside the confined cabin.  "I told you that the only thing I remembered was my mother... and the desire to find my mother."  He clenched his jaw tight as his hooves shuffled to a stop.  "...but that was a lie."

	Silence.

	Eagle gazed thinly across the dim interior.  "What?  That... that you were searching for your mother?  I mean, who else are you writing to—?"

	"Not that.  That part is true.  What I'm trying to tell you is that I was lying to you because I... I-I was leaving something out."  With a gulp, Ebon swiveled around and slowly sat on the edge of the bottom cot.  "Something else that I actually remembered... and still do."

	Eagle Eye nodded slowly.  "Please, Ebon.  Do go on."

	The stallion avoided Eagle's gaze, staring instead at the metal floor.  His ears folded over his head like a guilty foal.  "Whatever happened to me... it took away everything I know about where I was born... what I did for a living... where I came from..."  He glanced lethargically at his haunches.  "How or why I got this stupid cutie mark..."

	Eagle Eye patiently listened.

	Ebon went on, "But... th-there is one thing I do remember.  My first memory, and it's much... much clearer than anything else in my head.  I don't even remember my mother's face like I remember this."  He gazed up with a quivering lip.  His voice cracked, "I remember the pony who found me."

	Eagle leaned his head to the side.  "The pony who... f-found you?"

	"He... h-he was a trader."  Ebon gulped.  "Or a merchant.  He owned a skiff that he used to travel up and down the rivers of eastern Ledomare.
