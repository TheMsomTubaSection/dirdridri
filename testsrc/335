uh?  No... it's... it's very tasty... I..."  Eagle winced.

	Ebon looked down.  The glass was full.

	Eagle Eye gulped.  "Guess I'm not very thirsty..."  He fidgeted.  "Or hungry..."

	"I see..."

	"It was still very nice of you to prepare it for the crew."

	"Heh..."  Ebon ran a hoof through his mane and shrugged.  "We got practically overloaded from the turtles' generosity in Abinadi."  He looked at the stallion, smiling warmly.  "It's gonna be really, really hard to feel guilty over gluttony for a while."

	"So, no more of you barking at us to fast?"

	"Hah!"  Ebon shook his head and giggled.  "No... noooo.  No more of that.  I'm... uh... I-I'm sorry for being so hard on everypony.  I know it's not cool to be abrasive."

	"You have a very important job here on the Jury.  Nopony envies it... but we all respect you for it."

	"That's... uh... that's good to know."

	"Yeah..."

	Silence.
	
	Ebon bit his lip.  His ears folded against his better judgment.  "Eagle... is..."  He looked at him with glossy eyes.  "...is something wrong?"

	Eagle blinked.  He turned towards him.  "Wrong?"  He shook his head.  "Nothing's wrong."

	"You sure you're f-feeling alright?"

	Eagle opened his mouth.  "I feel..."  His features tensed.

	Ebon stared at him.

	Eagle exhaled and formed a weak smile.  "I feel that the worst is behind us..."

	Ebon nodded.  "Because the best is right before us, right—?"  He gasped.

	Eagle Eye was hugging him dearly, nuzzling his neck down and over the back of Ebon's head.  "No," he said, rubbing his cheek softly through the stallion's mane.  "Because the best is right here."

	Ebon exhaled.  He smiled, and his eyes watered.  So he closed them, lifting his head up to nuzzle against Eagle's chin.  "I... I was sc-scared..."

	"What for?"

	"Because... I... I dunno... I guess just—"

	"Ebon, look at me."  Eagle leaned back and stared the pony face to face.  "There is nothing... nothing to be afraid of."

	Ebon squinted quizzocally.

	"You are right where you need to be," Eagle said.  He smiled gently.  "We... are right where we need to be."  A slight giggle.  "And I couldn't be happier."

	Ebon sniffled again and smiled.

	"Okay?"

	Ebon nodded and squeaked back, "Okay."

	Eagle smiled, and yet his tail drooped behind him as he glanced aside at the bulkheads.

	"You look exhausted."

	"Guess I can't help it."

	"Here..." Ebon took the glass from him and stepped back.  "I'll take this for you.  There's plenty more where it came from."  He motioned down the adjacent hallway with his head.  "Why don't you get some shuteye?  If Zaid tells another zinger, I'll be sure to tell you."

	"Won't that be something to wake up to?"

	"Heheheheh...."  Ebon chuckled.  He stepped back, smiling.  He smiled some more.  Then, finally, he turned around, taking his eyes off Eagle as he made for the rest of the group.

	Eagle Eye turned around.  He made two steps... three... and slowed to a crawl.  With a pained expression, he leaned against the doorframe to the hallway.  His lungs heaved as if having carried the weight of the Noble Jury on his shoulder.  Clenchings his eyes shut, he fought tears, then gazed forward into the dim shadows beyond the crew quarters.




	Eagle Eye sweated anxiously from where he stood in the Navigation Room.

	Elma Boreal's green eyes narrowed.  "You're dying to ask something, aren't you?"

	Eagle opened his mouth... lingered... and eventually blurted, "How did you know you were freed from Chrysalis the moment that it happened?"

	Elma blinked.  "That's not what you wanted to ask me."

	Eagle was already nodding.  "The question that really bothers me is something I'll have to figure out on my own."

	"Very well."  Elma trotted quietly towards him.  "You want to know how sure I am of my connection to Chrysalis?  I'll tell you."  She shuffled to a stop, locking eyes with the stallion.  "When I became my natural self... when the outer shell of Elma Boreal was—for the first time ever—completely shattered, I felt as
