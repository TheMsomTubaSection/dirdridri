r tower.  "The elders await, Sivrem."

	"Calm down, Jerrio," Sivrem said with a chuckle.  He flapped his wings and dove forward.  "I've got this."

	Kitsune gestured for Rainbow to hold back, so she did.  Craning her neck, Rainbow watched as Sivrem touched down on the platform.  It was so low to the forest floor that the canopy shadowed most of the wooden surface, making for a cool and relaxing shade.  The longer Rainbow stared, she could make out several clusters of equine shapes lounging about in the sanctuary that the platform afforded.

	"Is that where all the old ponies live?" Rainbow asked.

	"Mmmm... mostly the First-Borns who become Gray Feathers," Kitsune explained.

	"All ponies are welcome to congregate there," Jerrio chimed in.  "But the Inner Sanctum belongs to the Gray Feathers.  Only they can open the door to the Gold Lights."

	"Uh huh..."  Rainbow nodded.  "Where exactly are the 'Gold Lights?'"

	Jerrio fidgeted in midair.

	"Oh... oops?"  Rainbow smiled awkwardly.  "Am I not supposed to know where they are?"

	"That... is up to the Gray Feathers to share," Jerrio quietly remarked.

	"What he said," Kitsune said with a smile.

	"Kitsune!  Jerrio!" A pony called out from up above.  The wind whistled.  Rainbow looked up to see a middle-aged stallion gliding down, only to be followed closely by no less than three dozen fillies and colts.  "Is it true?  Do you have the outsider with you?"

	"The one and only, Ice!" Kitsune said with a smile.  "Giving the little gulls their morning exercise!"

	"You bet!"  Ice said with a smirk.  "But I couldn't resist swinging by just once!"  He squinted from where he glided in a slowly descending circle, accompanied by fast-feathered foals.  "Whoah... her mane really is the real deal!  Just like they said!"

	"Uhhh..."  Rainbow nodded.  "I'm afraid so."

	"Whoah!" A colt gasped in a scratchy voice.  "She talks!"

	"Of course she talks!" A filly raspberried at him.  "She's a pony, isn't she?"

	"From beyond the greens?!"  Another colt made a face.  "Could she be a frost ghost?"

	Rainbow squinted.  "Frost... ghost...?"

	"Yeah, well, can a frost ghost make colored lights appear out of thin air?!" Smythe said with a grin.

	"What?!"

	"No way!"

	"She can make lights?!"

	"Sure can!"  Rayvinne winked at the circling youngsters.  "With explosions like thunder too!"

	"Cooooool!"

	"That's so awesome!"

	"I wanna see!"

	Jerrio sighed.  "Now's not exactly a good time, Ice..."

	"Oh, lemme guess..."  The stallion smirked in mid-glide.  "Off to feather the Gray Feathers, eh?"

	"Sivrem's chatting with the elders right now," Kitsune said.

	"By Valkyrie's shout!  How exciting!"

	"Ice, can we stay and watch the outsider make lights?"

	"Pleeeeeeease?"

	"Oh, do let them stay!"  Jagold snatched two random foals with her forelimbs and nuzzled them closely.  "Heeeeeeee!  Life can never be too adorable!"

	"Gaah!  Bleack!"

	"She smells like spider webs!"

	"Heheh... I get the point..."  Ice winked and let loose a shrill whistle.  "Alright, my little sparrows!"  He motioned towards the youngsters and ascended high above the treetops.  "We have fruit to gather for lunch, then it's lesson time!  Quickly, now!  Let's gust!"

	"Alright, Ice!"

	"Coming!"

	"Bye, Miss Outsider!"

	"I really like your mane!"

	The fillies and colts took off after the stallion.  The group of foals glided along the northern horizon, disappearing beyond the mist.

	Jagold blinked, hovering alone.  "Awwwwwwwwwww..."  She sighed, ears drooping.  Smythe drifted over with a chuckle and patted her shoulder.

	"Ice is so good with those gulls," Rayvinne remarked.  "I only wish my wingteacher was half as pleasant as that stallion when I was little."

	"You should take up flocking with the youngsters yourself, Ray," Kitsune said.  "It'd put your talents to good use."

	"Pffft.  Eggshells to that!"  Rayvinne smirked.  "I'd kiss my social life good bye."

	"Hah!  As if you only ever settle for kissing."

	"Wuh oh.  Somepony's c
