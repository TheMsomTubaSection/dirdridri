."  Kera squirmed where she stood.  "You've been very busy n'stuff."

	"Still, it's no excuse.  You guys are like family to me."  Rainbow stood up and shuffled around until she faced her.  "How are you doing, girl?"

	"You mean... you're not gonna keep grinding my gears over being up?"

	"That'd be like... uhm... the pot holder drawing the corn kernel black... or something."

	Kera giggled.  "How about we both stick to stuff we understand saying?"

	"Pffft.  Agreed."  Rainbow rolled her eyes.  "I'm no Belle or Pilate."

	"You could say that again."

	Rainbow tilted her head aside.  "You don't like them?  I figured they were basically your folks by now."

	"Please... I love 'em to death!"  Kera trotted over to Rainbow's side.  "But you wouldn't be you if you just repeated them all the time."  Her emerald eyes narrowed like daggers.  "Especially around me."

	Rainbow gulped.  "Gotya."

	"You've been sick or something?"

	"Huh?"

	"Everypony on the Jury keeps talking about how you keep getting dizzier and dizzier," Kera said.  "A lot of them are worried sick, but I don't think they've got the guts to talk about it."

	Rainbow gulped.  "Even Roarke?"

	Kera blinked.  "Why you so bent out of shape over Roarke?"

	Rainbow bit her lip and looked away.  "Forget I ever said anything."

	"Why?"

	"Because... it's n-not important..."

	"Why?"

	"Because it's true!" Rainbow suddenly barked.  "I am sick and it's not getting any better!"

	Kera leaned back, blinking awkwardly.

	Rainbow winced.  "I... I-I'm sorry, kid... I..."  She ran a hoof through her hair and shuddered.  "Enough about me."  She gulped.  "How are you holding up?  For real, though?"

	"I... uhm... I'm getting along, I guess."  Kera squatted down on folded legs.  "At least I think so..."

	"Oh yeah?"

	Kera sighed out her nostrils.  "Yeah."  She gulped.  "But, like, everytime I think I'm A-Okay... something rears its ugly head and I'm a shivering mess."  She rolled her eyes.  "I can't stand it.  And, if you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it."

	"Heh... fair enough," Rainbow said.  "But, for what it's worth, you're doing super-well in my book."

	"Since when did you read books?"

	"I mean it, kid," Rainbow said.  "An adoracute little smartass is a stone's throw from a drooling ragdoll anyday."

	"Heeheehee..."  Kera smirked.  "I wasn't that bad."

	"Yeah."  Rainbow nodded firmly.  "You were."

	"Mrmmmff..."  Kera rested a pouting chin on her forelimbs and stared off.  "Whatever.  At least Belle, Pilate, and Roarke have been super supportive."

	Rainbow raised an eyebrow.  "Roarke?"

	"Mmmmhmmmm."

	"What did Roarke do?"

	"She let me throw a huge boulder at her."

	Rainbow blinked.  "Oh..."  She blinked again.  "...really?"

	"Yeah.  I nearly killed her.  It was cool."

	"Sounds like it."

	"Apparently I've got a lot of super powerful mana juice inside me or something," Kera said.  "I mean, I knew I always had what it took to make major sparkles happen, but apparently it's all real earth-shattering stuff."  Kera shrugged.  "I used to think having that much power would be cool.  But now that I'm owning up to it..."

	"It weighs on you a lot more than you had hoped, huh?"

	"Yeah.  Kinda sorta."  Kera tilted her chin up.  "How did you know?"

	"Because I've lived it, girl," Rainbow murmured with a nod.  "Through in through."

	Silence.

	Kera asked, "So... are these ponies your brothers and sisters or something?"

	"Hmmm?"

	"You keep spending long days outside of the ship, hanging with these pegasi."

	"Yeah.  I guess I have."

	"The others are saying that it's because they're related to you or something."

	"More or less.  I mean... they're descendants of ancient Equestrians."

	"That's where you came from, though, right?"  Kera asked.  "Equestria?"

	"Heh.  You know your stuff, kid."

	"So... are you going to point them west so that they could fly home or something?"

	Rainbow gulped.  "It's not that simple.  And even if it were, I wouldn't have them leave t
