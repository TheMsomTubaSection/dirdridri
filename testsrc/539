trols.  "Close enough."

	"Yo yo, Stephen Haykings!"  Rainbow peered her colorful head out.  "You doing anything at the moment?"

	"Uhhhh..."  Booster gulped.  "Besides acting as sole guardspony to a dying town in the shadow of a dragon one week or two before everyone's inevitable exodus?"

	"Pfft!  Buck that noise!  Hop on board!"

	"And do what, exactly?"

	Rainbow grinned wide, her teeth glistening in the starlight.  "A midnight science experiment!"

	Booster blinked.  He smiled rosily.  "Fascinating..."

	"Yup!"  Rainbow grabbed his forelimb.  "Bring your brain along with your gerunds, smart guy!"

	"Ackies!" he yelped as he was yanked on board.

	"And hold on!"  Rainbow shouted above the roar of mana engines as Roarke lifted the sphere back into the sky.  "It's gonna be a bumpy ride!"

	"Is something wrong, Belle?" Eagle Eye asked.

	"Mrmmmf... yes..." Belle tiredly trotted past the stallion in the navigation and approached the hanging curtain to the observation room.  "Me."

	"What do you mean?"  He trotted after her, looking concerned.

	"Last night, I..."  She sighed.  "I sort of blew up at Rainbow Dash."

	"Blew up at her?"

	"I've been so upset over her health as of late."  She gulped.  "I-I let it get the better of me."

	"Belle..." Eagle Eye smiled.  "We're all concerned about Rainbow Dash.  She would understand that—"

	"It's still no excuse to take it out on her," Belle said with a shudder.  "Just because I want what's best for her doesn't mean I do."  She clenched her teeth.  "She needs us to support her in whatever she's doing more than we need her to make us feel better.  It's tough to do when you know deep down inside that you'll always be ten times weaker than the likes of her, even when she's at her worst."

	"You gotta admit," Eagle said.  "Rainbow Dash is her own worst enemy.  Whether it's Amulek or Val Roa, Rainbow Dash is the kind of mare to gladly destroy herself over what she considers right."

	"I know, but..."  Belle fought tears.  "Who are we to stop that?"  She gulped.  "Even if that's what we want to do?"

	Eagle Eye fumbled for words.

	Belle sighed.  "I-I don't know what to do anymore, Eagle Eye.  Except for one thing... apologize."  She pivoted towards the observation room.  "Ahem..."  She raised a hoof and knocked against the doorframe.  "Erm... Rainbow?" She gulped.  "Rainbow Dash?  It's me... Bellesmith.  I hope I'm not waking you.  I... I-I just wanted to tell you how terribly sorry I am for last night.  Pilate and I had a long talk about it.  Neither of us may be very fond of the way in which you've been overexerting yourself as of late, but that's no excuse for us to snap at you like the way we did.  You were right, Rainbow.  We're Eljunbyro.  We should have the utmost faith in you at all times.  And we do, Rainbow Dash!  It's just... it's just so hard when we know that you've got so little left to give and... and..."  She fought back the urge to cry.  "We love you so very much, Rainbow.  We wish things could be better for you at this point in your journey, Austraeoh or not.  Would you have it in your heart to forgive me?  To forgive us?"

	Silence.

	Eagle Eye fidgeted awkwardly.

	Belle blinked.  "Erm... Rainbow?"

	More silence.

	Belle glanced back at Eagle Eye.

	Eagle Eye shrugged.

	Pensively, Belle pulled the curtain aside.  "Rainbow Dash—?"

	Her body froze in place.

	In the golden glow of morning, every square inch of the observation room was exposed, and there was not a single hint of blue fuzz to be seen.

	"Uhhhhhhhhh..."  Eagle Eye stammered.

	"She's not here!"  Belle stood with her muzzle agape.  "But where... h-how...?"

	"Whizzball," said Props.

	Both ponies jumped—startled—and gawked at her.

	"Huh?!" Belle blinked.

	Props took another bite of an apple, gulped it down, and said, "Sometime last night.  She and Roarke.  Together."  She smiled.  "Ebony's serving breakfast upstairs!
