 in to nuzzle her.  After a breath he spoke to Roarke.  "There has to be a reason for this vision... this new symbol that Rainbow Dash is seeing."

	"Could it be another flame?" Roarke asked.  "She's seen those before."

	"Yes, but this isn't anything like it," Pilate said.  "At least, not the way Rainbow describes it.  There's no mention of the color lavender.  What's more, this vision has a definite shape, instead of just being a vague light source that only she can sense."

	Floydien shrugged.  "Once a glimmer, always a glimmer."

	"No, Mr. Floydien, this is definitely different," Pilate said firmly.  "And it angers me that I can't come up with a solid explanation for it!"

	"But you are familiar with the symbol...?" Roarke said.

	"I've seen it—yes—but I have no way of deciphering it."  The zebra sighed.  "And, apparently, neither does Kera."

	"I wish we had some sequencing equipment," Belle said, sniffling.  "Maybe there's something new inside Rainbow Dash, now.  A new spark to the Austraeoh that I could somehow examine for a solution..."

	"And where would such shimmer metal be found?"  Floydien tightened his jaw.  "The boomers out here prefer wood and flame to clank and embers!  Yes yes!"

	"I do not believe that there is any point in us trying to ascertain the situation any more than we already have," Roarke said.  "If you ask me, I believe the answer has already been given to us."

	Pilate tilted his head aside.  "How do you mean?"

	"Yaerfaerda," Roarke uttered.  "It can't be any coincidence that it has appeared to Rainbow Dash during the most intense throes of her chaotic condition.  I believe the symbol is as much a beacon as the flames have been.  Perhaps more so."

	"You think we can help Rainbow Dash by following it?" Belle remarked.

	"We owe it to her to try," Roarke said.  After a deep breath, she turned towards Floydien.  "Change our course.  We are no longer headed to Val Roa."  She glanced down the vertical crawlspace.  "Not without Rainbow Dash in good health..."

		// Getting the Hang of It		//------------------------------//

	Rainbow Dash lay on her side, stirring ever so slightly in her sleep.  The mare's muzzle tensed while her ears flicked one after the other.

	As soon as a brown hoof reached up from beneath the hammock and gently stroked the pony's chin, Rainbow Dash murmured an unintelligible noise.

	"Rainbow Dash..."  Roarke's voice spoke.  "Rainbow...?"

	"Mmmrmmf... hrmmmm..."

	"You must get up," Roarke continued.  "Please.  I insist.  This will only take a moment."

	"Grff... so m-many moments..."

	"I know.  I know."  Roarke's forelimb pushed Rainbow Dash straight up in a sitting position.  "Now, open your eyes."

	"Mrnngnhhhh... f-fiiiiine..."  Rainbow's eyelids parted ways.  A pair of jaded ruby pupils squinted at the starry night beyond the observation room's windows.  "What am I looking for?"

	"Do you see the Yaerfaerda simble?"

	"Guhhh... yes..."  Rainbow yawned.  "Of course..."

	"Is it straight ahead of us?"

	"Gzz-zzzzz..."

	"...Rainbow."

	"Snkkkt-zrkk-huh?  What?"

	"The symbol..."

	"Oh.  It's... it's..."  Rainbow lazily rolled a hoof through the air.  "A bit to the right..."

	"How much?"

	"Huh?"

	"How far to the right?"

	"Eugh... I dunno.  Just—like—to the edge of the windows.  Starboard side."  Rainbow's head teetered.  "Not sure what it matters anyway."

	Roarke was busy craning her head towards the vertical crawlspace behind her.  "Forty-five degrees towards starboard!  Bend south!"

	"Yes yes yes!" Floydien's voice echoed back down.  "Adjusting to your metal muzzle mutter!"

	Rainbow blinked.  "Uhhhhh... Roarke?"  She glanced aside.  "What are you doing—?"

	"Look now, Rainbow," Roarke said as the Noble Jury stopped pivoting.  "Are we facing it now?"

	"Huh?"

	"The symbol.  Is it dead-center with the windows, now?"

	"Uh... n-no?"

	"Where is it, then?"

	"Like—just a sneeze to the left.  Why—?"

	Roarke tilted her head towards
