œYour mane color.  Is it a common trait in Cloudsdale?  Or in all of Equestria for that matter?â€

    â€œJee, I dunno.â€  Rainbow Dash shrugged.  â€œI never given it much thoughtâ€¦â€

    â€œGiven what much thought?â€ Josho asked.

    â€œWell, I meanâ€¦ no.  There arenâ€™t any other ponies in Equestria with my mane color.  None that Iâ€™ve seen, at least.  With one exception, of course.â€  Rainbow Dash fidgeted.  â€œMy dad.  Butâ€¦ uhmâ€¦ I b-barely have any memories of him.  He didnâ€™t exactly hang around much.â€

    â€œDrap them an' lae them, huh?â€ Prowse remarked.

    Rainbowâ€™s eyes sliced his way like ruby daggers.  â€œHe died, ya beardborg.â€

    â€œOhâ€¦â€  Prowse rubbed a flesh leg with a metal hoof, avoiding her gaze.

    Sighing, Rainbow looked towards the others.  â€œAnd donâ€™t get me started on my mom, cuz Iâ€™ve honestly got nothing to go by.  I kind ofâ€¦ grew up on my own.  I really didnâ€™t like attention at first--at least not the kind everypony gave me.  Tons of ponies were gushing all over me, full of pity nâ€™crap.  I think thatâ€™s why I decided that the only way to live was awesomely, cuz then I could earn everyponyâ€™s praise, yâ€™know?â€  She smiled awkwardly.  â€œBoy, did I tick a lot of pegasi off in those days.  But it was worth it.  I stopped being a charity case and became a legend pretty darn quick, yâ€™know?â€

    â€œWhat a pleasant life story,â€ Josho droned.  â€œCan somepony tell me where weâ€™re going with this?â€

    â€œDo you remember any striking details ponies gave you about your mane color, Rainbow?â€ Pilate asked.

    â€œUgh.  Please.  I grew up with older mares wanting to turn me into a diva left and right!â€  Rainbow rolled her eyes.  â€œThey said that I had â€˜the most beautiful and rare mane in all of Equestriaâ€™ and that â€˜it was a shame for me to not go into modelingâ€™ or some junk.  Brbrbrrbrbrbbrrr.â€  She shivered from head to tail.  â€œEven Rarity gave me a bunch of that same crap.  I just did my best to ignore it.â€

    â€œAny doctors or physicians state that there was legitimacy behind the rare trait?â€

    â€œSo maybe at a physical or two I was told that I was a one-in-a-gazillion case!  Whatâ€™s the big deal?!â€  Rainbow Dash flung her hooves towards the tomb.  â€œWhatâ€™s this got to do with anything?â€

    â€œRainbow Dash, let it not be denied that you exist for a purpose,â€ Pilate said.  â€œIt would go against everything you, myself, and Bellesmith have discovered to ignore the ramifications of Austraeoh and being Austraeoh.  Now, I am a scientist at heart, and yet Iâ€™ve given into believing the elements of prophecy we have extracted throughout our journey due to sheer exposure.  But, pragmatically speaking, if there was an actual empirical explanation for what you are and what youâ€™re destined to do, then itâ€™s safe to hypothesize that youâ€™re not the first one equipped with the faculties to do it.â€

    â€œThe hay are you getting at, buddy?â€ Rainbowâ€™s voice cracked.  She pointed at the tomb.  â€œThat Hurricane wasâ€¦ wasâ€¦another me?â€

    â€œOr vice versa; you are another her.â€

    â€œPffft.  Come onnnnnâ€¦â€  Rainbow smirked.  â€œTrue, so maybe Iâ€™ve always fancied Hurricane the most whenever I was forced to watch a Hearthâ€™s Warming pageant, but that never meant we were anything alike!â€

    â€œArenâ€™t you?â€  Pilate faced the pegasusâ€™ general direction.  â€œYou both ended up flying east, did you not?â€

    â€œYeah, but--â€  Rainbow Dash froze, blinking.  She turned towards the tomb, fidgeting in midair.  â€œ...balls.â€
