 across the clearing.  Her breath left her as her ears twitched.

	Roarke stood across the clearing, staring into the hug.  Her braids danced in the warm morning wind... and she smiled.

	Rainbow Dash blinked.  She clasped her lips together and grinned, a warm, lingering, amorous smile of contentment.

	Roarke exhaled calmly, her cheeks starting to match the color of her mane.

	Rainbow's teeth showed beneath her smile.  She heard somethingâ€”a shift in the wind.  She tilted her head up from the center of the Jury, staring into the clear blue sky.  For a second there she thought she saw something streaking overhead, the hint of dark red scales, and then those wings were gone once more.  Her head fell to the mountain as the shadow slipped by, and then she glanced east.

	Yaerfaerda was in another place, a distant, far-off destination.  And now it glistened with a distinctly lavender shine.

	Rainbow blinked, and she put on her best smirk.  "Heh..."  Closing her eyes, she calmly drifted back down to earth, caught in the loving hooves of Pilate, Belle, and Kera.  "Awesome."
