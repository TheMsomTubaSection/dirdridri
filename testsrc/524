 a notch, Roarke," Rainbow said, frowning.  "You've already shoved your hoof in your mouth—"

	"Rainbow, you cannot afford to throw yourself into something like this now!" Roarke snarled.  "Neither can we afford to let you!"

	Rainbow gawked at Roarke.

	Eventually, Roarke caved, bowing her head as she shuddered.  "I... I-I mean..."  She sighed.  "Your condition, Rainbow.  It... it just isn't the right time, and—"

	"I know where you're coming from, Roarke."  Rainbow gulped.  "But there's something I haven't told you guys... something I just figured out."

	"And what's that, Rainbow?" Pilate asked.

	"These ponies say that their mines are north of here," Rainbow said.  "And that's where the dragon came from."  She stared firmly at her friends.  "Guess where I'm sensing this weird glowing symbol as we speak?"

	Roarke looked up, her lenses retracting.

	Belle's muzzle hung open.  "Blessed Spark... do you mean—?"

	Rainbow slowly nodded.

	"But... but..."  Belle grimaced.  "I don't understand!  Why is the symbol resonating from here?"

	"I don't know," Rainbow said.  "But maybe Axan does."  She gulped.  "Maybe this was her way of drawing me here..."

	"And to what, Rainbow?" Pilate asked.

	"...the fate of Austraeoh."

	A cold hush fell through the group.

	"Look, I may not have a lot of juice left in me," Rainbow said.  "But this is totally a situation worth squeezing.  If I fly past here, I fly past whatever's making me tick, and I'll never figure out this darn 'Yaerfaerda' thing."

	"Maybe you're not supposed to, Rainbow," Roarke droned.

	"Do you seriously believe that?"

	Roarke grimaced.  "I... I-I do not know what to believe."

	"That makes the two of us, sister," Rainbow said.  "But I'm not so cowardly that I won't bother trying."

	"I never said you were."

	"Then I'm glad to have you on my side."  Rainbow Dash stood up boldly and stared at the villagers.  "When's the next expedition heading out to the mines?"

	Merigold turned towards Booster.  "Mr. Spice...?"

	"Erm..."  Booster adjusted his goggles and said, "Tomorrow morning.  Bright an early."

	Rainbow nodded with a devilish smirk.  "You've got yourself a new dragon hunter."

	"Well, I'm coming with you," Josho said, cleaning his shotgun from where he sat on the opposite end of the mess hall's lounge.  "I'm not particularly fond of these silver-sucking hickjobs.  I dunno about you all, but having actual ponies east of Alafreo shoot iron death at us was a pretty nifty wake-up call.  I'm proud to lend a hoof."

	"Not sure there's much to lend in this situation, Josho," Rainbow Dash said, hovering in a tight little circle.  Starlight twinkled outside the portholes.  "Somehow, I feel as though what's freaking out these ponies is mostly just inside their heads."

	"Just like I said!  Hickjobs to the core!"

	"Rainbow, what do you mean by that?" Belle asked.  "Clearly everypony here in Amulek has seen something... something that they fear greatly."

	"It just doesn't make any sense!" Rainbow's voice cracked.  "Why would Axan hold up here of all places and do this to a bunch of strangers?!"

	"You're certain it's not like her?" Pilate asked.  "I mean, she has a rather nasty history of taking up roost right under ponies' noses and terrorizing them for generations."

	"Yeah, but she's past that now... ya think?"  Rainbow folded her arms in mid-hover.  "Ever since Silvadel, she's had this... this dragon boner for 'following Austraeoh around.'  Seems counter-intuitive for her to turn heel once more."

	"More like double-heel, the way I see it," Josho said.

	"Am I tired?" Eagle Eye muttered, rubbing his head.  "Or did Rainbow just say 'dragon boner?'"

	"She's in the twilight of her years, Rainbow," Belle said.  "A dying Divine."

	"So?"

	"So... what if she's losing her mind?"  Belle gestured.  "It's happened to her siblings before.  Maybe Axan's reverted to her past self without knowing it?"
