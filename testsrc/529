head—she did a double-take at Rainbow's gaze.  "What?"

	Rainbow slowly smiled.  "It's almost as if you were genuinely concerned about them."

	"I... am genuinely concerned about them," Roarke droned.  She stared down at her hooves, fidgeting.  "Is that truly so hard to believe?"

	"Mmmm... no..."  Rainbow leaned down to nuzzle her.  "But I like it, all the same."

	Keebroo popped up between the two of them.  "Hey!  Want to see the mine shafts?"

	Rainbow winced, rolled her eyes, then put on a sweet smile.  "Sure thing, bud!  Just... uh..."  She glanced at Roarke, then back at him.  "...show the way!"



	Minutes later, Roarke and Rainbow tailed Keebroo to the northern edge of the encampment.  They could hear the stallions barking at one another while they set up the launcher, but they were too far away to be seen in the blinding mists.  While the trek was awkward and treacherous for the two mares, Keebroo obviously knew his way.  The young stallion darted left and right, skirting around abandoned wagons and collapsed structures.

	At last, the grass gave way to gravel and stone.  Mine-cart tracks appeared, leading down a dark, dark hole in the side of the mountain.

	"Aaaaaaaand... voila!"  Keebroo gestured down the shaft.  "There it be!  The best silver deposits in all the land!"

	"I... did not expect us to be able to get this close," Roarke said, her lenses whirring as she looked about fitfully.  "Surely the dragon—"

	"One time, she didn't show up for an entire day," Keebroo said.  "We thought that she was gone for good, but it turns out she was just biding her time.  We... uh..."  He ran a hoof through his mane, sighing.  "We nearly got an equipment hut rebuilt by the time she struck.  We tried running into the shaft for cover, but that's when she started spitting fire.  We were driven back.  For all our efforts, we still haven't been able to fully access the mine for weeks..."

	"I can't help but think that just being here is taunting her," Roarke said.

	"Well... uhm..."  Keebroo gulped.  "That's the whole point... y'know?  We gotta show that we're not afraid of her... th-that we can take her out!"  He blinked at the ponies with wide eyes.  "I mean... that's why you're here too, huh?  To help us?"

	"Hrmmm... more or less."  Roarke clenched her jaw.  "Still, I don't like this.  Everything's too quiet."

	"Like I said, sometime the dragon bides—"

	"It doesn't make sense... not from what I've learned about dragons and how territorial they can be," Roarke said.  "Why hasn't she attacked yet?"

	"I... I-I wish I could tell you."  Keebroo gulped.  "I thought you ponies had experience with dragons or something like that."

	"One of us does."  Roarke pivoted and glanced up.  "How about it, Rainbow?  Does any of this make sense to you?"  Her lenses retracted.  "... ... ... Rainbow?"

	Rainbow Dash hovered in place, shivering.  She stared down the mineshaft in a cold sweat.

	Roarke's lips pursed.  "Rainbow!"  She trotted up and lifted a hoof, giving Rainbow's tail a tug.  "Look at me!"

	At last, Rainbow wrenched her eyes from the shaft.  Sweat was collecting around her brow.

	Roarke asked in a quiet voice, "Is it happening again?  Are you—?"

	"No."  Rainbow shook her head.  "It's not that.  It's... something else..."

	"Like...?"

	Rainbow gritted her teeth as she stared down the shaft.  The symbol was as close as ever now, practically blinding with its light.  The longer she peered into the mine, the more she was certain the lines and circles would burn into her retinae.

	"It's here, Roarke..."

	"What is?  Yaerfaerda?"

	"It's.  Right.  Here."  Rainbow gulped.  "I can practically taste it, I'm so close."

	Roarke glanced down the shaft.  Her lenses pistoned outward to their full length.  "I don't see a thing."

	"Trust me, it's down there."

	"Uhm..."  Keebroo gulped.  "What is?"

	"Silence, breeder."  Roarke trotted closer to Rainbow.  "Rainbow, should... should we go down and investigate?"

	"No!  Not a good idea!" Keebroo stammered.  "If
