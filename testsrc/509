 I'm hoping to find out."  Rainbow sniffed and sniffed.  "Is that eggs I smell in your mane?"

	"Derrrrrr—"

	"Goddess, I'm famished!  I could eat a whole bowl full of carrots.  Stalks and all."

	"Jee..." Ebon smiled.  "I wonder why—mmfmfmmff!"  He gagged siddenly on Eagle's lavender tail.

	"Hrmmm... c-can't quite get the color down," Rainbow said.  "But it'll have to do for now."  She finally leaned back from what she had just hastily scribbled onto the back of the map in black ink.  "Pilate, would you mind doing that voodoo you do?"

	"Huh?  Oh... uhm..."  The zebra trotted forward, activating O.A.S.I.S.  "By all means."  The sphere floated up and levitated over the desk.  "I do hope you haven't just vandalized one of Mr. Floydien's treasured maps."

	"Odds are I only defaced one of several Ledomaritan provinces," Rainbow droned.  "The dayum elk can cry me a river.  You scanning yet?"

	"Patience, dear friend," Pilate said.  "Trying to take it all in..."

	"That's a fancy diagram, Rainbow," Eagle said.

	"If you say so."

	"How'd you knock it out so fast?"

	"Well, army guy, if you must know—I can't stop friggin' seeing it."

	"Ptooie!"  Ebon rubbed his fuzzy muzzle.  "Seeing it?"

	"Like..."  Props blinked.  "It's in this room?"

	"Did I or did I not tell you that I ain't crazy?"

	"Eheheh...well..."

	Rainbow swiveled in the chair and pointed past the observation room beyond the door.  "It's over there."

	"Towards the bow?"

	"East.  And it won't go away."

	"Wait..."  Belle leaned forward.  "You mean, like a beacon, Rainbow Dash?"

	"This isn't like any of the machine world flames I've seen before," Rainbow said.  She gulped and curled her hooves to her chest.  "I can—like—see it with my eyes shut."

	"But... only when you face east?"

	"More or less.  It's super freaky, and it's not aligned with the Sun."

	"So, swing your hammock westward!"  Ebon said with a grin.

	Rainbow turned and glared at him.

	"Aaaaaaaaaaaand shuttingupnow," Ebon squeaked, hiding behind a smirking Eagle Eye.

	"Why you seeing it now out of nowhere?" Props asked.

	"I... I really don't know."

	"Rainbow, we can't rightly expect all of this 'Austraeoh' business to function with total rhyme and reason," Belle said.

	"Can't we, though?"  Rainbow stared at her.  She then pivoted towards Roarke.  "Hey, Roarke, you there, girl?"

	The ex bounty hunter jolted.  "Hmmm?"  She looked up.

	"Just making sure you're still with me."  Rainbow smirked.

	"Yes, Rainbow," Roarke said with a nod.  "I am still with you."

	Ebon glanced at Roarke, then at Rainbow Dash.  He remained silent.

	"O... kay..."  Pilate licked his lips as the manasphere stopped flickering over the table and retreated back to his metal choker.  "I do believe I have it."

	"Good!"  Rainbow swiveled to face him, her face bright and curious.  "Focus on it with them mimetic stripes of yours!"  Her eyes narrowed.  "Do you recognize it at all?"

	Pilate's brow furrowed in deep thought.

	"Foxtaur... Stratopolis...?"  Rainbow gulped.  "...the tome?"

	"I... d-do believe... I have seen it before," Pilate said.

	"For real?"

	"Indeed.  If I recall, this particular symbol showed up on rare occasions, and almost exclusively when there was also an occurrence of the Eljunbyro and Odrsjot characters."

	"Is that so?"  Belle blinked.  "I wonder why."

	"Is there a connection?" Rainbow asked.  "Like... what could it mean?"

	"I..."  Pilate winced.  "I am sorry, Rainbow, but I cannot say.  The patterns don't hold any meaning to me."

	"Do you at least know what it could mean in Xonan?" Rainbow asked.

	"'Yaefaerda,"' Kera mumbled, her mouth full of eggs.

	Everypony swiveled to face the little filly.

	"Yiffy what now?" Rainbow balked.

	Kera gulped and scooped another clump of scrambled eggs from the levitating plate beside her.  "'Yaefaerda,'" she repeated, pointing at the drawing with her floating fork.  "At least, that's what Nightshade taught me... before I single-hoofedly blew her popsi
