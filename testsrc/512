ly now that she's extra sticky!"

	"Dammit, Propsicle, who is this?  I can't put my hoof on his voice!  Is he the blind one?"

	"Uhhhh... duaaaaaaah..."  Props batted the microphone back and forth between her hooves.  "Oh noes!  You're breaking up, Unky Prowsy!  It must be a lightning storm!"

	"A lightning what-now?"

	"Give Xona a shot!  We'll catch you on the flipside!  Okie dokie!  Bye bye!"  Props flicked the communications array off and exhaled heavily.

	Zaid glanced at Props.  "You think the Tarkington could even catch up with us at this point?"

	"If anypony can make an engine purr like a kitten, it's my uncle."  Props looked up at him with a thin smile.  "I'm sure he'll join us beside Rainbow in no time."

	Zaid gulped.  "That's what I was afraid of."

	"Buh?"

	"I don't look forward to being on the receiving end of a boomstick."

	"Awwwwwwwww..."  Props stood up.  "Ya silly bean!"  She hugged Zaid, nuzzling his neck with her blonde mane.  "It won't be like that!"

	Zaid sighed through a smile.  "Ah... well... if you say so, then I feel better."

	"Yeah..."  Props closed her eyes, grinning.  "Besides, my Uncle likes to beat ponies up with a wrench before shooting them."

	Zaid's pupils shrank.

	"Hey!  I know!  Heehee!  You wanna have some more cheese?"

	Zaid whimpered, "For as long as I have left to live..."






	Clouds sped past the porthole windows of the mess hall as Roarke trotted through the chamber.  She passed by a bowl of salad lying at the end of the table.  Suddenly, the metal mare stopped.  She pivoted her neck and stared with rotating lenses at the meal.  After a few seconds, she trotted towards the kitchen.

	"Ebon," she spoke quietly.  "I see that Rainbow Dash's place in the table has an uneaten meal."

	The stallion stepped out of the kitchen.  He gazed blankly at the mare.

	"Is she not hungry?" Roarke asked.  "It seems odd for her to give up such good greenery."

	Ebon kept staring.

	Roarke's brow furrowed.  "Ebon?  Is there something wrong with your ears?"

	The stallion twitched.  "S-sorry.  Heheh..."  He rubbed his neck nervously.  "I'm just not used to you calling me anything but 'breeder.'"

	Roarke exhaled heavily through her nostrils.

	Ebon gulped.  "Right."  He pointed at the table.  "I made that for Rainbow ten minutes ago.  She was about to eat, but said she forgot something she left in her room.  I... g-guess she hasn't been back since."

	Roarke turned towards the table.  "Mmmmmm..."

	"Hey!  Would you like to remind her that her lunch is served?  I'm sure she'd hate for it to go to waste."

	"I think I will do one better," Roarke said.  She turned and glanced at him one last time.  "Thank you, Ebon."

	Ebon blinked, then smiled sweetly.  "It's my pleasure, Roarke."



	Roarke expertly climbed down the vertical crawlspace while balancing the bowl with a prehensile metal tail.  At last, she reached the bottom, pivoted about, and shuffled into the observation room.  Daylight shimmered through breaking clouds, glinting off her metal parts as she entered.

	"Rainbow Dash, I did the favor of bringing Ebon's meal to you.  Perhaps you would be more comfortable eating he—"  Roarke froze in her tracks.

	Rainbow Dash was lying limp on the floor.

	Roarke's lenses rattled.  "Rainbow...?"  She dove forward.  "Rainbow!"

	Clack!  The bowl fell to the floor behind her, spilling lettuce and other vegetables across the floor.

	Roarke squatted at the pegasus' side and lifted her in her forelimbs.  "Rainbow?!  Speak!  Say something—"

	"I hear you.  I hear you," Rainbow hissed, stirring numbly in Roarke's grip, but completely awake.  "I... unghh... heard you the first time."  She gulped.  "Just calm down..."

	"You are... fine, then?"

	"I'm okay," Rainbow wheezed, nevertheless draping off of Roarke's hooves.  "Really..."

	Roarke sneered.  "You are not fine!  Is it another dizzy spell?"

	"No..."

	"Rainbow..."

	"Okay, yes, it was," Rainbow muttered.  "But it's over now.  Still... damn things take t
