saved my friends... empowered them."

	"You would have done the same for them in time."

	"I could have.  But would I?"  Rainbow gulped.  "You're the loyalest pony there is.  You filled in all the gaps.  I... I just..."

	"Rainbow..."

	"I'm not worthy..."  Rainbow murmured.  A gulp.  "And yet here you are."  She slowly shook her head.  "I just... I..."  A fidgeting.  "I can't say anything."

	"Pretend that you can."

	"I'm so lucky.  So friggin' lucky."  Rainbow exhaled with a shuddering smile.  "Thanks for showing me."

	"Hmmm..."  Roarke's ears twitched.  "Thanks for letting me see stars."

	"Snkkkt-Heeheehee!"  Rainbow Dash curled up against Roarke again.  "Is that all it comes down to?"

	Roarke was silent.

	"...Roarke?"

	"Would you... uhm..."

	"Hmmm?"

	Roarke bit her lip and finally said, "Would you t-touch my braids again?"

	Smiling, Rainbow complied, running her hoof through the mare's braids.  She flounced one after another, letting the ringlets collide and make clinking sounds like gold coins.  "Heh... they're so cool," she said.  "I should have mine done just like these."

	"No." Something rumbled in Roarke's chest as her lenses pistoned out.  "Keep your mane as it is."

	Rainbow shrunk inward a little.  "Y-yes, ma'am."  She nevertheless continued to toy with the braids, collecting as many as she could around her fetlock.  "Heh... I love these darn things, but I can't help but wonder what you look like with it all hanging out."

	"Is that what you wish?"

	"Huh?"  Rainbow blinked. She chuckled nervously.  "Pffft!  I-I was just thinking out loud, Roarke—"

	"You know, Rainbow," Roarke spoke suddenly, "I have shared a bed with many partners in my life."

	Rainbow couldn't help but cringe.  "That's... n-not exactly something you should be t-talking about right now, ya think—?"

	"Rainbow..."  Roarke stretched her forelimbs out for the first time and grasped Rainbow's hoof.  She leaned forward.  "...I have never had a lover before."

	Rainbow stared at her.

	"I have never... never..."  Roarke winced in mid-speech.  She tilted her head down at Rainbow's hoof.  "Searo's womb, I should just stay silent..."

	Rainbow leaned in and gently nuzzled Roarke's cheek.  Roarke exhaled calmly, her body going limp as Rainbow continued to rub the side of her muzzle against Roarke's.  Rainbow leaned in even further, stroking the curve of her neck against the side of Roarke's head and then over her mane.  She then slid her face down, kissing along Roarke's forehead and towards her nose, finally ending with a feather-light contact of their lips.  She leaned back, stroking Roarke's hooves with her own.

	"Like that?" she said.

	Roarke quivered.  She sniffled and nodded timidly.

	"Now..."  Rainbow Dash leaned in again, pressing her cheek against Roarke's.  "Forget Searo... and just say anything."

	Rainbow could feel the heavy heartbeat in Roarke's body.  After a prolonged silence, the mare eventually spoke.

	"I've b-been falling apart for a long t-time," Roarke stammered.  "Even before I met you.  Before I met Imre.  I knew that once everything had peeled loose, I'd have have to meet my end.  I just... d-didn't expect that there'd be a new me on the other side.  I would never admit it... but... but I was frightened, Rainbow.  I've been very frightened..."

	"Yeah..."  Rainbow silently nodded, nuzzling the mare.  "...I sorta figured."

	"But... but it's not as b-bad as I thought..."  Roarke clenched her teeth, seething slightly.  "It... it hurts to admit it.  Because it feels like weakness.  But it's something else... the complete opposite, perhaps?"

	"Mmmmhmmm..."

	"Rainbow..."

	Rainbow sat up so she could look down at the mare.

	A pair of lenses reflected Rainbow's face twice over.  "Whether you knew it or not... whether you meant to or not... you caught me as I fell through.  And... and I-I can't stop dwelling on it... thinking about it."  Roarke gulped.  "I-I'm sorry for being so distant in Durandana.  Lately, I've been out of grips with myself
