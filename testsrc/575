	"You... you feel things... and I-I taste those feelings."  A gulp.  "And I feast..."  A sneer.  "And I starve!"

	"Ebon..."

	"I wish to Goddess that I knew sooner..."  The thing sobbed, head bowing.  "I w-would have fled!  I would have rid every one of you of th-this danger!"

	"I couldn't let that happen, Ebon!" Eagle said.  He shook the creature's shoulders.  "I promised myself I would not let you go harm's way!"

	Just then, the creature's head jerked up.  Its glossy eyes narrowed.  "You knew?"

	Eagle Eye held his tongue.

	"You... knew, didn't you?"  The changeling gulped.  "For h-how long..."

	"Ebon..."

	"For how long, EE?!" its alien voice warbled.

	Eagle took a deep breath.  "...since Stratopolis, Ebon."

	The creature slumped against the cabinet, shivering.

	"Listen to me..."  Eagle crawled closer, reaching a tender hoof towards the thing's shoulder.  "I can't pretend to know what you're thinking, but trust me.  You are the Ebon Mane of Gray Smoke.  You are the Ebon Mane who made friends with Props.  And you are the Ebon Mane who joined the jury and brought peace and contentment to my life.  It is not a curse and it is not a magic spell, Ebon.  I love you.  I... I..."  He winced.  "I'm so sorry, Ebon.  I'm s-so sorry that you had to find out this way.  I should have told you, but I was scared.  I was scared and I was selfish b-because I didn't want you punishing youself in a panic like this..."  He gulped.  "...and I didn't want you leaving me."

	The creature hugged itself, rocking back and forth.

	"Ebon..."  Eagle sniffed, wiped his cheek dry and leaned forward.  "Ebon, please, tell me what you are feeling..."

	The changeling panted and panted.  More tears trickled down its shell.  "I'm sc-scared, EE..."  Its eyes darted towards the ex-mercenary.  "I'm so scared..."  It whimpered and shook.  "But how can I?  What right do I have to be scared?"  It gulped.  "I'm not real..."

	"Yes you are."

	"Don't say that.  You can't possibly know that!"  It clenched its eyes shut.  "If I open my eyes again... what will I be?  Who will I be?  Will I even be alive?!  Mmmmff..."  It curled its hollow forelimbs before its petite face.  "Grhhhh... I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know—"

	"Ebon, listen to me, you are real."

	"I'm not.  I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm—"

	"And was Elma any less real when she found out?!" Eagle blurted.  "And was she poisoning us to love and care for her?!"

	"Not the s-same.  Not... it's n-not—"

	"Ebon..."  Eagle grabbed the creature's hooves and hoisted it up in a jerk.  "Open your eyes!"

	"Mmmm—!"

	"Open them!"

	The changeling squinted at Eagle, weak and feeble, trembling.

	Eagle smiled.  "I'm still here.  And so are you."  He sniffled, but fought to maintain his grin.  "And I am never... ever leaving you.  I promise with my whole heart.  I will keep you safe.  I will help you through this."

	It blinked at the stallion.  Its body trembled, and when it finally collapsed, it was with its face buried in Eagle's chest.  Anguished, muffled sobs racked its carapace.  Eagle folded his forelimbs around it, holding the creature close.

	Nevertheless, the changeling whimpered and wailed, "Oh Eagle, it's n-no use!  It won't work.  It c-can't work!"

	"Shhhh... We can make it work!"

	"No we c-can't!"  The thing hiccuped and whimpered, "I'm just a freak... a m-monster!"

	"Ebon—"

	"If you won't hurt me, they will!"  It shivered.  "Floydien... Josho... the Jury..."

	"They'll understand..."  Eagle fidgeted.  "I... I-I'm almost certain of—"

	"Roarke!  If she finds out, then wh-what?!"

	Eagle froze in place, his violet pupils shrinking.

	"Nopony will have me!  Not here!  Not anywhere!"

	"Ebon, just calm d-down.  I..."  Eagle grimaced, looking all over the infirmary.  "I n-need to think.  I..."

	"EE, I'm so scared!  Please..."  It sobbed and shivered in the stallion's embrace, a tiny flutter of what the earth pony once was.  "Help me.  I beg of you.  I d-don't know what to do
