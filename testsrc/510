cle stand!"

	"Wait... You escaped Nightshade Industries alone?" Props gasped.  A blink.  "You stole my breakfast?!"

	"Hey, you snooze, you lose."  Kera burped.  "Or... mrmmmfff... in your coltfriend's case, you snooze and ooze.  Heeheehee—BURRP!"

	Pilate sighed long and hard.  "I'm going to have a very long talk with that stallion..."

	"But... like..."  Rainbow fidgeted, glancing anxiously at Kera.  "You have any clue what the word means?"

	Kera shrugged.  "I'unno."  She took another bite and trotted into the next room.  "Didn't know what 'Odrsjot' was all about until it came up and bit me!"

	Rainbow Dash stared after her.  She sighed, slumping against the table as her ruby eyes traced the lines and circles.  "Nnnngh... just what I need.  More of this crap."

	"Relax, Rainbow."  Belle said, resting a hoof on the mare's shoulder.  "At least you knew to be on top of it!"

	"And it's not as though we're completely in the dark," Pilate said with a smile.  "At least now we have a name to go by."

	"Mrmmf... thanks to Kera."

	"Heheh... yes... as always... thanks to Kera."

	"No need to be anxious, Dashie!"  Props slid in with a grin.  "You're used to this, aren't ya?  Besides... pffft... it's not like you've got a half-dozen more of these discover or anything silly like that!"

	A dull pair of ruby eyes glared at Props.

	The blonde mare stared with a frozen grin.  "... ... ...I'm gonna go try contacting Unky Prowsy again!"  And she swiveled about and marched into the engine room.

	"We're... uh... going to help her," Eagle said, trotting out of the room.

	Ebon blinked.  "We are?  Eep!"  He felt himself being tugged away.  The engine room door closed behind them.

	Meanwhile, Belle was leaning in and whispering something to Pilate.  Pilate murmured something back, then tilted his ears towards Roarke.  After a knowing nod, he pivoted Rainbow's way.  "We can discuss this another time.  Shall we tell Floydien to embark for Val Roa once again?"

	"Uhhhh... yeah, sure."  Rainbow nodded.  "Totally."

	"Very well then."  The couple trotted out.

	"And... y'know..."  Rainbow waved, smiling.  "Thanks.  As always."

	"Hmmm..."  Belle smiled back.  "Don't thank just us."  And she and Pilate left, leaving the door slightly cracked.

	Swallowing, Rainbow twirled around.  She looked at Roarke.

	Roarke looked at her.

	"Hey..."  Rainbow said, waving.

	Roarke's head tilted forward and back.  "Greetings."

	Rainbow raised an eyebrow, but she nevertheless cleared her throat and said, "I... uhm... I-I'm sorry for... like... m-making things so awkward... j-just now."  She gulped.  "I really... really wanted to avoid an awkward morning at all costs."

	"Awkwardness was inevitable," Roarke droned.

	"Oh?"  Rainbow looked up with doe eyes.  Her ears folded as she glanced down.  "Oh..."  She fidgeted in her seat.  "Oh, yeah... I guess so.."

	Silence.

	At last, Roarke drifted forward,  She tossed her mane until a few slender braids cascaded over her shoulder.  She presented them before Rainbow Dash.  "Here..."

	"...?"  Rainbow glanced curiously at the gesture.

	"You... do enjoy toying with them so much," Roarke said softly.  "It seems to make things... less awkward."

	Rainbow blinked.  "Hmmm..."  Her fuzzy cheeks turned rosy.  "Yeah.  But I can think of a faster way to do the same thing."

	"Hmm?  What is that—?"  Roarke wheezed as Rainbow flew over and hugged her tightly, nuzzling the mare cheek to cheek.

	"Therrrrre..."  Rainbow hummed with their muzzles together.  "Does that get the stiffness out?"

	Roarke exhaled.  "In a manner of speaking..."

	"Heeheehee... dang it, girl!  We gotta work on loosening that tongue of yours!"

	"Hrmmm.  You would certainly be the expert on that."

	"Huh?"  Rainbow blinked and leaned back.  "What do you mean by—"

	Roarke's muzzle was curved.

	Rainbow twitched.  She rolled her eyes.  "Ungh!  Dang it!"  She ran a hoof through her mane as she chuckled.  "I did not see that coming."

	"Neither did I last evening."
