ke droned.

	"Do you recognize it?" Rainbow asked.

	Roarke gave Rainbow a double-glance.  "No," she said.  Her brow furrowed.  "Don't you?"

	"No."

	"Then why did you draw it?"

	"Because I woke up seeing it," Rainbow said.  She swallowed a lump down her throat.  "Just now..."  She gazed towards the east horizon.  "...and it won't go away.  Even when I close my eyes."

	Roarke gazed through the trees.  Her lenses twirled and clicked within their frames.

	"You don't see it, do you?" Rainbow muttered.

	Roarke took a deep breath.  She rested a hoof gently on Rainbow's neck.  "I think we should get you back to the Jury..."

	Rainbow slowly, slowly nodded, gazing east in a hypnotic way.  "I think you should get me back there too..."

	"So, that's when I said, 'Khao, you can lead a horse to a water, but you can't make her clop!'"

	Props paused halfway through her plate of eggs.

	Ebon winced from where he sat besides Eagle Eye.

	Pilate and Belle sat in dead silence while Kera scarfed her plate up.

	"Annnnnd yeah... that's when the Herald officially put me on latrine duty," Zaid finished with a nervous smile.

	More dead silence.

	Zaid gulped.  "This isn't helping, isn't it?"

	"Nope."

	"Uh uh."

	"No no no."

	"All we can think about is Rainbow Dash and Roarke."

	"Same here."

	"Yes yes yes."

	"Pffft.  Yeah, well..."  Zaid shrugged and slumped against the mess hall table.  "It's not like I didn't try."

	"Awwwww... and you gave it a good try, Zaidy Waidy!"  Props grinned, lifting him back up by his shoulder.  "But sometimes you just gotta let sleeping mares—"

	The Noble Jury shook suddenly with the tell-tale signs of a hovercraft docking within the hangar.

	"Nancy shakes!"  Floydien exclaimed.  "The black ball return turns!"

	"Squee!"  Props hopped out of her seat, letting go of Zaid.

	"Guaah—" THUD!  His chin hit the table first before his body ragdolled onto the floor.  "Ooof!"

	"I wanna be the first mare to shake their hooves!"  Props sing-songed, hop-hop-hopping through the kitchen.

	"Propsy!  Hold up!"  Ebon galloped after her.  "Don't crowd in on them!"

	"Ebonnnnn!"  Eagle's voice cracked as he scampered behind them.  "Don't crowd in on her crowding in on them!  Just hold on!"

	"Mmmmmmm..."  Kera licked her plate clean, burped, then pointed at where Props had just sat.  "You think she's gonna finish it?"

	"Uhhhhh..."  Belle glanced at Pilate.  The couple stood up in unison.  "Have your fill, darling.  We'll be... r-right back."

	"Indeed."  Pilate rested a hoof on Belle's side as the two briskly trotted towards the ship's rear.

	"Heeeee!"  Kera zipped towards Props' place and began attacking her scrambled eggs.  "Mmmmm... so scrumptioustastical!"

	"Mmmf... gross gross," Floydien stood up and walked the opposite way.

	"Guh..."  Zaid stood back up, his dizzy eyes seeing stars.  "Heh-heh."  He grinned crookedly.  'Raindoarke.'  Phweeeeeee."  Thwump!



	The hangar had just closed, and the doors to the Lounge sphere were beginning to hiss open at the precise moment that Props and several other Jurists skidded to a stop.

	"Woohoo!"  Props bounced up high, pumping a hoof in the air.  "Hail the conquering heroes!"

	"Uhhh..."  Ebon blinked curiously.  "Just who is conquering who, exactly?"

	"Fine, Ebony.  Heehee..."  Props rolled her blue eyes with a mischievous grin.  "Conkin' heroes."

	Ebon blanched.  "You've been hanging around Zaid too much."

	"He smells just fine once you get to know his insides."

	"Wat."

	Eagle Eye rushed up, breathless.  "Come on, guys!  Can't we just give them some space?"

	"Funny you should say that!"  Props winked.  "Cuz I bet they soared waaaaay into outer space last night!  Heehee!"

	"Unnngh..."  Eagle face-hooved intensely.  "My dear sweet gentle puppy-nuzzling Spark..."

	At last, Rainbow Dash stepped out, followed by Roarke.

	"Welcome back, ladies!"  Props f
