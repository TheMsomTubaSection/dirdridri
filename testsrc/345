 adjusting the pendant around her neck.  "What do you think?"

	"Hmmm..."

	"Long story short, I've had no choice but to accept my life for what it is... or—more realistically—what it isn't."  She gulped.  "Words such as 'orphan' and 'outcast' and 'homeless' don't really have that much of a punch to my heart.  Because it's not like it can be helped, y'know?  At least not in my case.  So, I might as well make the best of it all, and seize the things around me that I really, really love."  She smiled at the stallion.  "The Noble Jury is my family.  This ship of Floydien's is pretty much my home.  And—"

	"You getting to a point somewhere or do I gotta shove you towards the finishing line?" Josho muttered.

	"Yeah, there's a point."  Rainbow nodded, staring at him.  "The point is that Eagle Eye's kind of in the same boat as me, but thanks to you, he's not sinking.  And it's funny, cuz I envy him."

	"You what-now?"  Josho glanced over.

	Rainbow gulped.  Her voice wavered, "I would kill to have a dad like you."  A few seconds passed, and she smiled calmly beneath a pair of glossy eyes.  "Anypony would, really.  Just..." She gulped.  "Pure inspiration, ya feel me?"

	Josho's nostrils flared.  He glanced off the starboard side.  "I don't take much stock in feeling."

	"At least you admit you can," Rainbow said.  "I think that's the real reason Eagle's happy these days."

	"Mrmmmf... maybe..."

	Silence.

	"You can head on down, now," Rainbow said, ruffling her wingfeathers.  "I'm out here to keep watch, is all."

	"Eh..."  Josho shrugged.  "I'll stick around with ya."

	Rainbow smirked at his glowing horn.  "I was born in Cloudsdale.  I can deal with the temperature."

	"Who said anything about the temperature?"

	Rainbow opened her mouth... but paused.  With a blink, she smiled.

	Both ponies stared out at the passing mountainside.

	"... ... ...so what do you think is really waiting for us in that crater?" Josho grumbled.

	"Eh... some ancient horror that'll probably wanna fry us all to a crisp."

	"Great.  Wonder what Sailboat's cooking tonight."

	"I dunno.  Something crunchy, I hope."

	"Oh, girl, I'd castrate myself for 'crunchy.'"

	"Heeheehee..."

	"Alright... how about now?"

	"A screwdriver," Pilate said.

	Belle nodded, then glanced down at Kera.

	Kera floated the screwdriver behind her back, licked at her lips, and levitated an empty mug in its place.

	Belle turned to her mate.  "And now?"

	Pilate's metal brow furrowed.  Meanwhile, the O.A.S.I.S. sphere—dangling from his choker—fired a manabeam into the ocular array over his eyes.  A swath of amber and red energy flickered across Kera and the object floating in front of her.

	After two and a half seconds, Pilate's ears twitched and the zebra said, "A cup."

	"Very nice."  Belle smiled down at the filly.  "Kera, darling, pick something of your choice.  Be random."

	"Really?"

	"Hmmm.  Yes, really."

	Kera clenched one eye shut, her horn glowing brightly.  Soon, something slipped out from deep within the roots of her mane.  She waved it in the air between her and Pilate.  "Ta daaaa!  What am I holding up now?"

	"Eungh..."  Belle face-hoofed.  "Kera..."

	Pilate smirked, trying not to chuckle.  "I do believe that is a grasshopper leg."

	"Did you really use the O.A. to determine that?"

	"Yes and no, but that's the beauty of how I 'visualize' things," Pilate said.

	"Well, all and all, this is looking very good!"  Belle said with a grin.  "So far, you've been observing things with about eighty percent accuracy!"

	"I still didn't know how I couldn't recognize the third item," he said.

	"That's because Kera was holding the horseshoe the wrong way."

	"Hey!"  Kera pouted.

	Belle giggled.  "I'm only teasing, dear."  She reached down and straightened the filly's mane.  "You've been very helpful."

	"Eh."  She shrugged.  "It beats hiding in Ebon's cupboard and pret
